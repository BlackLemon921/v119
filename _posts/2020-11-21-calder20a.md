abstract: We propose a new framework, called Poisson learning, for graph based semi-supervised
  learning at very low label rates. Poisson learning is motivated by the need to address
  the degeneracy of Laplacian semi-supervised learning in this regime. The method
  replaces the assignment of label values at training points with the placement of
  sources and sinks, and solves the resulting Poisson equation on the graph. The outcomes
  are provably more stable and informative than those of Laplacian learning. Poisson
  learning is efficient and simple to implement, and we present numerical experiments
  showing the method is superior to other recent approaches to semi-supervised learning
  at low label rates on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Cifar-10. We also propose a graph-cut
  enhancement of Poisson learning, called Poisson MBO, that gives higher accuracy
  and can incorporate prior knowledge of relative class sizes.
