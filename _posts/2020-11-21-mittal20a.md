abstract: Robust perception relies on both bottom-up and top-down signals. Bottom-up
  signals consist of what’s directly observed through sensation. Top-down signals
  consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and the current reportable
  short-term memory, such as how the phrase ‘peanut butter and ...’ will be completed.
  The optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open question,
  but the manner of combination must be dynamic and both context and task dependent.
  To effectively utilize the wealth of potential top-down information available, and
  to prevent the cacophony of intermixed signals in a bidirectional architecture,
  mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow. We explore deep recurrent neural
  net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined
  using attention. Modularity of the architecture further restricts the sharing and
  communication of information. Together, attention and modularity direct information
  flow, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language
  tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data. We
  demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image classification,
  video prediction and reinforcement learning that the \emph{bidirectional} information
  flow can improve results over strong baselines.
