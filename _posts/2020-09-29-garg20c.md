abstract: We address two fundamental questions about graph neural networks (GNNs).
  First, we prove that several important graph properties, e.g., shortest/longest
  cycle, diameter, or certain motifs, cannot be computed by GNNs that rely entirely
  on local information. Such GNNs include the standard message passing models, and
  more powerful spatial variants that exploit local graph structure (e.g., via relative
  orientation of messages, or local port ordering) to distinguish neighbors of each
  node. Our treatment includes a novel graph-theoretic formalism. Second, we provide
  the first data dependent generalization bounds for message passing GNNs. This analysis
  explicitly accounts for the local permutation invariance of GNNs. Our bounds are
  much tighter than existing VC-dimension based guarantees for GNNs, and are comparable
  to Rademacher bounds for recurrent neural networks.
