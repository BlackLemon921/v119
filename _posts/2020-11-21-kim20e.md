abstract: 'World models are self-supervised predictive models of how the world evolves.
  Humans learn world models by curiously exploring their environment, in the process
  acquiring compact abstractions of high bandwidth sensory inputs, the ability to
  plan across long temporal horizons, and an understanding of the behavioral patterns
  of other agents. In this work, we study how to design such a curiosity-driven Active
  World Model Learning (AWML) system. To do so, we construct a curious agent building
  world models while visually exploring a 3D physical environment rich with distillations
  of representative real-world agents. We propose an AWML system driven by $\gamma$-Progress:
  a scalable and effective learning progress-based curiosity signal and show that
  $\gamma$-Progress naturally gives rise to an exploration policy that directs attention
  to complex but learnable dynamics in a balanced manner, as a result overcoming the
  “white noise problem”. As a result, our $\gamma$-Progress-driven controller achieves
  significantly higher AWML performance than baseline controllers equipped with state-of-the-art
  exploration strategies such as Random Network Distillation and Model Disagreement.'
