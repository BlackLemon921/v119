abstract: Visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) require an
  interplay of visual perception with reasoning about the question semantics grounded
  in perception. However, recent advances in this area are still primarily driven
  by perception improvements (e.g. scene graph generation) rather than reasoning.
  Neuro-symbolic models such as Neural Module Networks bring the benefits of compositional
  reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning,
  and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own. To address this,
  we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately
  from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows
  the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this
  end, we introduce a Differentiable First-Order Logic formalism for VQA that explicitly
  decouples question answering from visual perception. On the challenging GQA dataset,
  this framework is used to perform in-depth, disentangled comparisons between well-known
  VQA models leading to informative insights regarding the participating models as
  well as the task.
