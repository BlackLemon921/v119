abstract: We propose a simple but effective data-driven channel pruning algorithm,
  which compresses deep neural networks in a differentiable way by exploiting the
  characteristics of operations. The proposed approach makes a joint consideration
  of batch normalization (BN) and rectified linear unit (ReLU) for channel pruning;
  it estimates how likely the two successive operations deactivate each feature map
  and prunes the channels with high probabilities. To this end, we learn differentiable
  masks for individual channels and make soft decisions throughout the optimization
  procedure, which facilitates to explore larger search space and train more stable
  networks. The proposed framework enables us to identify compressed models via a
  joint learning of model parameters and channel pruning without an extra procedure
  of fine-tuning. We perform extensive experiments and achieve outstanding performance
  in terms of the accuracy of output networks given the same amount of resources when
  compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
