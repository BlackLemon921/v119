abstract: Interest has been rising lately towards methods representing data in non-Euclidean
  spaces, e.g. hyperbolic or spherical that provide specific inductive biases useful
  for certain real-world data properties, e.g. scale-free, hierarchical or cyclical.
  However, the popular graph neural networks are currently limited in modeling data
  only via Euclidean geometry and associated vector space operations. Here, we bridge
  this gap by proposing mathematically grounded generalizations of graph convolutional
  networks (GCN) to (products of) constant curvature spaces. We do this by i) introducing
  a unified formalism permitting a differentiable interpolation between all geometries
  of constant curvature irrespective of their sign, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric
  coordinates that generalize the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass.
  Our class of models smoothly recover their Euclidean counterparts when the curvature
  goes to zero from either side. Empirically, we outperform Euclidean GCNs in the
  tasks of node classification and distortion minimization for symbolic data exhibiting
  non-Euclidean behavior, according to their discrete curvature.
