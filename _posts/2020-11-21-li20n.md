abstract: The variance reduction class of algorithms including the representative
  ones, SVRG and SARAH, have well documented merits for empirical risk minimization
  problems. However, they require grid search to tune parameters (step size and the
  number of iterations per inner loop) for optimal performance. This work introduces
  ‘almost tune-free’ SVRG and SARAH schemes equipped with i) Barzilai-Borwein (BB)
  step sizes; ii) averaging; and, iii) the inner loop length adjusted to the BB step
  sizes. In particular, SVRG, SARAH, and their BB variants are first reexamined through
  an ‘estimate sequence’ lens to enable new averaging methods that tighten their convergence
  rates theoretically, and improve their performance empirically when the step size
  or the inner loop length is chosen large. Then a simple yet effective means to adjust
  the number of iterations per inner loop is developed to enhance the merits of the
  proposed averaging schemes and BB step sizes. Numerical tests corroborate the proposed
  methods.
