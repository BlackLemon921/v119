abstract: While real-world decisions involve many competing objectives, algorithmic
  decisions are often evaluated with a single objective function. In this paper, we
  study algorithmic policies which explicitly trade off between a private objective
  (such as profit) and a public objective (such as social welfare). We analyze a natural
  class of policies which trace an empirical Pareto frontier based on learned scores,
  and focus on how such decisions can be made in noisy or data-limited regimes. Our
  theoretical results characterize the optimal strategies in this class, bound the
  Pareto errors due to inaccuracies in the scores, and show an equivalence between
  optimal strategies and a rich class of fairness-constrained profit-maximizing policies.
  We then present empirical results in two different contexts — online content recommendation
  and sustainable abalone fisheries — to underscore the generality of our approach
  to a wide range of practical decisions. Taken together, these results shed light
  on inherent trade-offs in using machine learning for decisions that impact social
  welfare.
