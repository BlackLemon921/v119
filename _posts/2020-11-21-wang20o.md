abstract: 'The proliferation of medical monitoring devices makes it possible to track
  health vitals at high frequency, enabling the development of dynamic health risk
  scores that change with the underlying readings. Survival analysis, in particular
  hazard estimation, is well-suited to analyzing this stream of data to predict disease
  onset as a function of the time-varying vitals. This paper introduces the software
  package BoXHED (pronounced ‘box-head’) for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions
  via gradient boosting. BoXHED 1.0 is a novel tree-based implementation of the generic
  estimator proposed in Lee et al. (2017), which was designed for handling time-dependent
  covariates in a fully nonparametric manner. BoXHED is also the first publicly available
  software implementation for Lee et al. (2017). Applying it to a cardiovascular disease
  dataset from the Framingham Heart Study reveals novel interaction effects among
  known risk factors, potentially resolving an open question in clinical literature.
  BoXHED is available from GitHub: www.github.com/BoXHED.'
