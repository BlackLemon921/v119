abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of routing multiple agents in a coordinated
  manner. This is a complex problem that has a wide range of applications in fleet
  management to achieve a common goal, such as mapping from a swarm of robots and
  ride sharing. Traditional methods are typically not designed for realistic environments
  which contain sparsely connected graphs and unknown traffic, and are often too slow
  in runtime to be practical. In contrast, we propose a graph neural network based
  model that is able to perform multi-agent routing based on learned value iteration
  in a sparsely connected graph with dynamically changing traffic conditions. Moreover,
  our learned communication module enables the agents to coordinate online and adapt
  to changes more effectively. We created a simulated environment to mimic realistic
  mapping performed by autonomous vehicles with unknown minimum edge coverage and
  traffic conditions; our approach significantly outperforms traditional solvers both
  in terms of total cost and runtime. We also show that our model trained with only
  two agents on graphs with a maximum of 25 nodes can easily generalize to situations
  with more agents and/or nodes.
