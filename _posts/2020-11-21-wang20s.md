abstract: Neural processes (NPs) constitute a family of variational approximate models
  for stochastic processes with promising properties in computational efficiency and
  uncertainty quantification. These processes use neural networks with latent variable
  inputs to induce a predictive distribution. However, the expressiveness of vanilla
  NPs is limited as they only use a global latent variable, while target-specific
  local variation may be crucial sometimes. To address this challenge, we investigate
  NPs systematically and present a new variant of NP model that we call Doubly Stochastic
  Variational Neural Process (DSVNP). This model combines the global latent variable
  and local latent variables for prediction. We evaluate this model in several experiments,
  and our results demonstrate competitive prediction performance in multi-output regression
  and uncertainty estimation in classification.
