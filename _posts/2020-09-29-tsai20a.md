abstract: Current transfer learning methods are mainly based on finetuning a pretrained
  model with target-domain data. Motivated by the techniques from adversarial machine
  learning (ML) that are capable of manipulating the model prediction via data perturbations,
  in this paper we propose a novel approach, black-box adversarial reprogramming (BAR),
  that repurposes a well-trained black-box ML model (e.g., a prediction API or a proprietary
  software) for solving different ML tasks, especially in the scenario with scarce
  data and constrained resources. The rationale lies in exploiting high-performance
  but unknown ML models to gain learning capability for transfer learning. Using zeroth
  order optimization and multi-label mapping techniques, BAR can reprogram a black-box
  ML model solely based on its input-output responses without knowing the model architecture
  or changing any parameter. More importantly, in the limited medical data setting,
  on autism spectrum disorder classification, diabetic retinopathy detection, and
  melanoma detection tasks, BAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields comparable
  performance to the vanilla adversarial reprogramming method requiring complete knowledge
  of the target ML model. BAR also outperforms baseline transfer learning approaches
  by a significant margin, demonstrating cost-effective means and new insights for
  transfer learning.
