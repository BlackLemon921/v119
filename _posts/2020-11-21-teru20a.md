abstract: The dominant paradigm for relation prediction in knowledge graphs involves
  learning and operating on latent representations (i.e., embeddings) of entities
  and relations. However, these embedding-based methods do not explicitly capture
  the compositional logical rules underlying the knowledge graph, and they are limited
  to the transductive setting, where the full set of entities must be known during
  training. Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation prediction framework,
  GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and has a strong inductive bias
  to learn entity-independent relational semantics. Unlike embedding-based models,
  GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize to unseen entities and graphs after
  training. We provide theoretical proof and strong empirical evidence that GraIL
  can rep-resent a useful subset of first-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms
  existing rule-induction baselines in the inductive setting. We also demonstrate
  significant gains obtained by ensembling GraIL with various knowledge graph embedding
  methods in the transductive setting, highlighting the complementary inductive bias
  of our method.
