abstract: Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds
  extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the
  manifold. One possible extension is the Fr{é}chet mean, the generalization of the
  Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a closed
  form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to differentiate
  through the Fr{é}chet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. Then, focusing on
  hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and a fast, accurate,
  and hyperparameter-free Fr{é}chet mean solver. This fully integrates the Fr{é}chet
  mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To demonstrate this integration,
  we present two case studies. First, we apply our Fr{é}chet mean to the existing
  Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, replacing its projected aggregation to obtain
  state-of-the-art results on datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate
  the Fr{é}chet mean’s capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations,
  we develop a hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel
  to the one observed in the Euclidean setting.
