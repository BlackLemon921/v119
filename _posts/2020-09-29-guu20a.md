abstract: Language model pre-training has been shown to capture a surprising amount
  of world knowledge, crucial for NLP tasks such as question answering. However, this
  knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring
  ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular
  and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge
  retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large
  corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For
  the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised
  manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating
  through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning
  on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare
  against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage
  on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods
  by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative
  benefits such as interpretability and modularity.
