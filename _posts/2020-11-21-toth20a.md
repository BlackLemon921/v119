abstract: We develop a Bayesian approach to learning from sequential data by using
  Gaussian processes (GPs) with so-called signature kernels as covariance functions.
  This allows to make sequences of different length comparable and to rely on strong
  theoretical results from stochastic analysis. Signatures capture sequential structure
  with tensors that can scale unfavourably in sequence length and state space dimension.
  To deal with this, we introduce a sparse variational approach with inducing tensors.
  We then combine the resulting GP with LSTMs and GRUs to build larger models that
  leverage the strengths of each of these approaches and benchmark the resulting GPs
  on multivariate time series (TS) classification datasets.
