abstract: Missing data has the potential to affect analyses conducted in all fields
  of scientific study including healthcare, economics, and the social sciences. Several
  approaches to unbiased inference in the presence of non-ignorable missingness rely
  on the specification of the target distribution and its missingness process as a
  probability distribution that factorizes with respect to a directed acyclic graph.
  In this paper, we address the longstanding question of the characterization of models
  that are identifiable within this class of missing data distributions. We provide
  the first completeness result in this field of study â€“ necessary and sufficient
  graphical conditions under which, the full data distribution can be recovered from
  the observed data distribution. We then simultaneously address issues that may arise
  due to the presence of both missing data and unmeasured confounding, by extending
  these graphical conditions and proofs of completeness, to settings where some variables
  are not just missing, but completely unobserved.
