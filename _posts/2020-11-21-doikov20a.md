abstract: 'In this paper, we study inexact high-order Tensor Methods for solving convex
  optimization problems with composite objective. At every step of such methods, we
  use approximate solution of the auxiliary problem, defined by the bound for the
  residual in function value. We propose two dynamic strategies for choosing the inner
  accuracy: the first one is decreasing as $1/k^{p + 1}$, where $p \geq 1$ is the
  order of the method and $k$ is the iteration counter, and the second approach is
  using for the inner accuracy the last progress in the target objective. We show
  that inexact Tensor Methods with these strategies achieve the same global convergence
  rate as in the error-free case. For the second approach we also establish local
  superlinear rates (for $p \geq 2$), and propose the accelerated scheme. Lastly,
  we present computational results on a variety of machine learning problems for several
  methods and different accuracy policies.'
