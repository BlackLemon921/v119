abstract: We develop amortized population Gibbs (APG) samplers, a class of scalable
  methods that frame structured variational inference as adaptive importance sampling.
  APG samplers construct high-dimensional proposals by iterating over updates to lower-dimensional
  blocks of variables. We train each conditional proposal by minimizing the inclusive
  KL divergence with respect to the conditional posterior. To appropriately account
  for the size of the input data, we develop a new parameterization in terms of neural
  sufficient statistics. Experiments show that APG samplers can be used to train highly-structured
  deep generative models in an unsupervised manner, and achieve substantial improvements
  in inference accuracy relative to standard autoencoding variational methods.
