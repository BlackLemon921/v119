abstract: 'With continual miniaturization ever more applications of deep learning
  can be found in embedded systems, where it is common to encounter data with natural
  representation in the complex domain. To this end we extend Sparse Variational Dropout
  to complex-valued neural networks and verify the proposed Bayesian technique by
  conducting a large numerical study of the performance-compression trade-off of C-valued
  networks on two tasks: image recognition on MNIST-like and CIFAR10 datasets and
  music transcription on MusicNet. We replicate the state-of-the-art result by Trabelsi
  et al. (2018) on MusicNet with a complex-valued network compressed by 50-100x at
  a small performance penalty.'
