abstract: Specifying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task involves choosing a suitable
  planning horizon, which is typically modeled by a discount factor. It is known that
  applying RL algorithms with a lower discount factor can act as a regularizer, improving
  performance in the limited data regime. Yet the exact nature of this regularizer
  has not been investigated. In this work, we fill in this gap. For several Temporal-Difference
  (TD) learning methods, we show an explicit equivalence between using a reduced discount
  factor and adding an explicit regularization term to the algorithmâ€™s loss. Motivated
  by the equivalence, we empirically study this technique compared to standard L2
  regularization by extensive experiments in discrete and continuous domains, using
  tabular and functional representations. Our experiments suggest the regularization
  effectiveness is strongly related to properties of the available data, such as size,
  distribution, and mixing rate.
