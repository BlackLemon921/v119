abstract: Explanation methods promise to make black-box classifiers more transparent.
  As a result, it is hoped that they can act as proof for a sensible, fair and trustworthy
  decision-making process of the algorithm and thereby increase its acceptance by
  the end-users. In this paper, we show both theoretically and experimentally that
  these hopes are presently unfounded. Specifically, we show that, for any classifier
  $g$, one can always construct another classifier $\tilde{g}$ which has the same
  behavior on the data (same train, validation, and test error) but has arbitrarily
  manipulated explanation maps. We derive this statement theoretically using differential
  geometry and demonstrate it experimentally for various explanation methods, architectures,
  and datasets. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we then propose a modification
  of existing explanation methods which makes them significantly more robust.
