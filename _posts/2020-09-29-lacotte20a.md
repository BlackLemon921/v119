abstract: We provide an exact analysis of a class of randomized algorithms for solving
  overdetermined least-squares problems. We consider first-order methods, where the
  gradients are pre-conditioned by an approximation of the Hessian, based on a subspace
  embedding of the data matrix. This class of algorithms encompasses several randomized
  methods among the fastest solvers for least-squares problems. We focus on two classical
  embeddings, namely, Gaussian projections and subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms
  (SRHT). Our key technical innovation is the derivation of the limiting spectral
  density of SRHT embeddings. Leveraging this novel result, we derive the family of
  normalized orthogonal polynomials of the SRHT density and we find the optimal pre-conditioned
  first-order method along with its rate of convergence. Our analysis of Gaussian
  embeddings proceeds similarly, and leverages classical random matrix theory results.
  In particular, we show that for a given sketch size, SRHT embeddings exhibits a
  faster rate of convergence than Gaussian embeddings. Then, we propose a new algorithm
  by optimizing the computational complexity over the choice of the sketching dimension.
  To our knowledge, our resulting algorithm yields the best known complexity for solving
  least-squares problems with no condition number dependence.
