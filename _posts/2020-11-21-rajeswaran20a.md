abstract: 'Designing stable and efficient algorithms for model-based reinforcement
  learning (MBRL) with function approximation has remained challenging despite growing
  interest in the field. To help expose the practical challenges in MBRL and simplify
  algorithm design from the lens of abstraction, we develop a new framework that casts
  MBRL as a game between: (1) a policy player, which attempts to maximize rewards
  under the learned model; (2) a model player, which attempts to fit the real-world
  data collected by the policy player. We show that a near-optimal policy for the
  environment can be obtained by finding an approximate equilibrium for aforementioned
  game, and we develop two families of algorithms to find the game equilibrium by
  drawing upon ideas from Stackelberg games. Experimental studies suggest that the
  proposed algorithms achieve state of the art sample efficiency, match the asymptotic
  performance of model-free policy gradient, and scale gracefully to high-dimensional
  tasks like dexterous hand manipulation. Project page: \url{https://sites.google.com/view/mbrl-game}.'
