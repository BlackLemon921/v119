abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle and Carbin, 2018), states that a
  randomly-initialized network contains a small subnetwork such that, when trained
  in isolation, can compete with the performance of the original network. We prove
  an even stronger hypothesis (as was also conjectured in Ramanujan et al., 2019),
  showing that for every bounded distribution and every target network with bounded
  weights, a sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains
  a subnetwork with roughly the same accuracy as the target network, without any further
  training.
