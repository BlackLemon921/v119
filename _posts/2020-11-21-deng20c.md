abstract: An acknowledged weakness of neural networks is their vulnerability to adversarial
  perturbations to the inputs. To improve the robustness of these models, one of the
  most popular defense mechanisms is to alternatively maximize the loss over the constrained
  perturbations (or called adversaries) on the inputs using projected gradient ascent
  and minimize over weights. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the maximization
  step towards understanding the experimentally observed effectiveness of this defense
  mechanism. Specifically, we investigate the non-concave landscape of the adversaries
  for a two-layer neural network with a quadratic loss. Our main result proves that
  projected gradient ascent finds a local maximum of this non-concave problem in a
  polynomial number of iterations with high probability. To our knowledge, this is
  the first work that provides a convergence analysis of the first-order adversaries.
  Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that, in the initial phase of adversarial training,
  the scale of the inputs matters in the sense that a smaller input scale leads to
  faster convergence of adversarial training and a “more regular” landscape. Finally,
  we show that these theoretical findings are in excellent agreement with a series
  of experiments.
