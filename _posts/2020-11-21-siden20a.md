abstract: Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are probabilistic graphical models
  widely used in spatial statistics and related fields to model dependencies over
  spatial structures. We establish a formal connection between GMRFs and convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs). Common GMRFs are special cases of a generative model where
  the inverse mapping from data to latent variables is given by a 1-layer linear CNN.
  This connection allows us to generalize GMRFs to multi-layer CNN architectures,
  effectively increasing the order of the corresponding GMRF in a way which has favorable
  computational scaling. We describe how well-established tools, such as autodiff
  and variational inference, can be used for simple and efficient inference and learning
  of the deep GMRF. We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model and show
  that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on a dataset of satellite temperatures,
  in terms of prediction and predictive uncertainty.
