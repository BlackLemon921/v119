abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm for solving group synchronization under
  high levels of corruption and noise, while we focus on rotation synchronization.
  We first describe our recent theoretically guaranteed message passing algorithm
  that estimates the corruption levels of the measured group ratios. We then propose
  a novel reweighted least squares method to estimate the group elements, where the
  weights are initialized and iteratively updated using the estimated corruption levels.
  We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods
  for rotation synchronization using both synthetic and real data.
