abstract: 'Dataset replication is a useful tool for assessing whether improvements
  in test accuracy on a specific benchmark correspond to improvements in modelsâ€™ ability
  to generalize reliably. In this work, we present unintuitive yet significant ways
  in which standard approaches to dataset replication introduce statistical bias,
  skewing the resulting observations. We study ImageNet-v2, a replication of the ImageNet
  dataset on which models exhibit a significant (11-14%) drop in accuracy, even after
  controlling for selection frequency, a human-in-the-loop measure of data quality.
  We show that after remeasuring selection frequencies and correcting for statistical
  bias, only an estimated 3.6% of the original 11.7% accuracy drop remains unaccounted
  for. We conclude with concrete recommendations for recognizing and avoiding bias
  in dataset replication. Code for our study is publicly available: https://git.io/data-rep-analysis.'
