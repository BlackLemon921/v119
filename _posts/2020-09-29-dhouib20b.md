abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theoretical analysis of unsupervised domain
  adaptation that relates notions of large margin separation, adversarial learning
  and optimal transport. This analysis generalizes previous work on the subject by
  providing a bound on the target margin violation rate, thus reflecting a better
  control of the quality of separation between classes in the target domain than bounding
  the misclassification rate. The bound also highlights the benefit of a large margin
  separation on the source domain for adaptation and introduces an optimal transport
  (OT) based distance between domains that has the virtue of being task-dependent,
  contrary to other approaches. From the obtained theoretical results, we derive a
  novel algorithmic solution for domain adaptation that introduces a novel shallow
  OT-based adversarial approach and outperforms other OT-based DA baselines on several
  simulated and real-world classification tasks.
