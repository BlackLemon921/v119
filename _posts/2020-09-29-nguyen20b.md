abstract: 'We introduce a new measure to evaluate the transferability of representations
  learned by classifiers. Our measure, the Log Expected Empirical Prediction (LEEP),
  is simple and easy to compute: when given a classifier trained on a source data
  set, it only requires running the target data set through this classifier once.
  We analyze the properties of LEEP theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
  empirically. Our analysis shows that LEEP can predict the performance and convergence
  speed of both transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced
  data. Moreover, LEEP outperforms recently proposed transferability measures such
  as negative conditional entropy and H scores. Notably, when transferring from ImageNet
  to CIFAR100, LEEP can achieve up to 30% improvement compared to the best competing
  method in terms of the correlations with actual transfer accuracy.'
