abstract: We develop a generic data-driven method for estimator selection in off-policy
  policy evaluation settings. We establish a strong performance guarantee for the
  method, showing that it is competitive with the oracle estimator, up to a constant
  factor. Via in-depth case studies in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning,
  we demonstrate the generality and applicability of the method. We also perform comprehensive
  experiments, demonstrating the empirical efficacy of our approach and comparing
  with related approaches. In both case studies, our method compares favorably with
  existing methods.
