abstract: We propose two novel conditional gradient-based methods for solving structured
  stochastic convex optimization problems with a large number of linear constraints.
  Instances of this template naturally arise from SDP-relaxations of combinatorial
  problems, which involve a number of constraints that is polynomial in the problem
  dimension. The most important feature of our framework is that only a subset of
  the constraints is processed at each iteration, thus gaining a computational advantage
  over prior works that require full passes. Our algorithms rely on variance reduction
  and smoothing used in conjunction with conditional gradient steps, and are accompanied
  by rigorous convergence guarantees. Preliminary numerical experiments are provided
  for illustrating the practical performance of the methods.
