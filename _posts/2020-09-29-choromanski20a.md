abstract: We present a new class of stochastic, geometrically-driven optimization
  algorithms on the orthogonal group O(d) and naturally reductive homogeneous manifolds
  obtained from the action of the rotation group SO(d). We theoretically and experimentally
  demonstrate that our methods can be applied in various fields of machine learning
  including deep, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning,
  normalizing flows and metric learning. We show an intriguing connection between
  efficient stochastic optimization on the orthogonal group and graph theory (e.g.
  matching problem, partition functions over graphs, graph-coloring). We leverage
  the theory of Lie groups and provide theoretical results for the designed class
  of algorithms. We demonstrate broad applicability of our methods by showing strong
  performance on the seemingly unrelated tasks of learning world models to obtain
  stable policies for the most difficult Humanoid agent from OpenAI Gym and improving
  convolutional neural networks.
