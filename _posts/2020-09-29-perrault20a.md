abstract: We introduce a new budgeted framework for online influence maximization,
  considering the total cost of an advertising campaign instead of the common cardinality
  constraint on a chosen influencer set. Our approach models better the real-world
  setting where the cost of influencers varies and advertizers want to find the best
  value for their overall social advertising budget. We propose an algorithm assuming
  an independent cascade diffusion model and edge-level semi-bandit feedback, and
  provide both theoretical and experimental results. Our analysis is also valid for
  the cardinality-constraint setting and improves the state of the art regret bound
  in this case.
