abstract: The Bayesian learning rule is a natural-gradient variational inference method,
  which not only contains many existing learning algorithms as special cases but also
  enables the design of new algorithms. Unfortunately, when variational parameters
  lie in an open constraint set, the rule may not satisfy the constraint and requires
  line-searches which could slow down the algorithm. In this work, we address this
  issue for positive-definite constraints by proposing an improved rule that naturally
  handles the constraints. Our modification is obtained by using Riemannian gradient
  methods, and is valid when the approximation attains a block-coordinate natural
  parameterization (e.g., Gaussian distributions and their mixtures). Our method outperforms
  existing methods without any significant increase in computation. Our work makes
  it easier to apply the rule in the presence of positive-definite constraints in
  parameter spaces.
