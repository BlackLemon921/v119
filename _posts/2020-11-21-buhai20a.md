abstract: One of the most surprising and exciting discoveries in supervised learning
  was the benefit of overparameterization (i.e. training a very large model) to improving
  the optimization landscape of a problem, with minimal effect on statistical performance
  (i.e. generalization). In contrast, unsupervised settings have been under-explored,
  despite the fact that it was observed that overparameterization can be helpful as
  early as Dasgupta & Schulman (2007). We perform an empirical study of different
  aspects of overparameterization in unsupervised learning of latent variable models
  via synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. We discuss benefits to different metrics
  of success (recovering the parameters of the ground-truth model, held-out log-likelihood),
  sensitivity to variations of the training algorithm, and behavior as the amount
  of overparameterization increases. We find that across a variety of models (noisy-OR
  networks, sparse coding, probabilistic context-free grammars) and training algorithms
  (variational inference, alternating minimization, expectation-maximization), overparameterization
  can significantly increase the number of ground truth latent variables recovered.
