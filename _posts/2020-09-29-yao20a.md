abstract: This paper explores a new research problem of unsupervised transfer learning
  across multiple spatiotemporal prediction tasks. Unlike most existing transfer learning
  methods that focus on fixing the discrepancy between supervised tasks, we study
  how to transfer knowledge from a zoo of unsupervisedly learned models towards another
  predictive network. Our motivation is that models from different sources are expected
  to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics from different perspectives, thereby
  effectively supplementing the new task, even if the task has sufficient training
  samples. Technically, we propose a differentiable framework named transferable memory.
  It adaptively distills knowledge from a bank of memory states of multiple pretrained
  RNNs, and applies it to the target network via a novel recurrent structure called
  the Transferable Memory Unit (TMU). Compared with finetuning, our approach yields
  significant improvements on three benchmarks for spatiotemporal prediction, and
  benefits the target task even from less relevant pretext ones.
