abstract: 'In visual planning (VP), an agent learns to plan goal-directed behavior
  from observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained
  from self-supervised robot interaction. Most previous works on VP approached the
  problem by planning in a learned latent space, resulting in low-quality visual plans,
  and difficult training algorithms. Here, instead, we propose a simple VP method
  that plans directly in image space and displays competitive performance. We build
  on the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method: image samples are treated
  as nodes in a graph, the graph connectivity is learned from image sequence data,
  and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. We propose
  two modifications on SPTM. First, we train an energy-based graph connectivity function
  using contrastive predictive coding that admits stable training. Second, to allow
  zero-shot planning in new domains, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates
  images given a context describing the domain, and use these hallucinated samples
  for building the connectivity graph and planning. We show that this simple approach
  significantly outperform the SOTA VP methods, in terms of both plan interpretability
  and success rate when using the plan to guide a trajectory-following controller.
  Interestingly, our method can pick up non-trivial visual properties of objects,
  such as their geometry, and account for it in the plans.'
