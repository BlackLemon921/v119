abstract: Online mirror descent (OMD) and dual averaging (DA)—two fundamental algorithms
  for online convex optimization—are known to have very similar (and sometimes identical)
  performance guarantees when used with a fixed learning rate. Under dynamic learning
  rates, however, OMD is provably inferior to DA and suffers a linear regret, even
  in common settings such as prediction with expert advice. We modify the OMD algorithm
  through a simple technique that we call stabilization. We give essentially the same
  abstract regret bound for OMD with stabilization and for DA by modifying the classical
  OMD convergence analysis in a careful and modular way that allows for straightforward
  and flexible proofs. Simple corollaries of these bounds show that OMD with stabilization
  and DA enjoy the same performance guarantees in many applications—even under dynamic
  learning rates. We also shed light on the similarities between OMD and DA and show
  simple conditions under which stabilized-OMD and DA generate the same iterates.
