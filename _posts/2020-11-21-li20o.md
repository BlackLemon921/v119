abstract: We give a row sampling algorithm for the quantile loss function with sample
  complexity nearly linear in the dimensionality of the data, improving upon the previous
  best algorithm whose sampling complexity has at least cubic dependence on the dimensionality.
  Based upon our row sampling algorithm, we give the fastest known algorithm for quantile
  regression and a graph sparsification algorithm for balanced directed graphs. Our
  main technical contribution is to show that Lewis weights sampling, which has been
  used in row sampling algorithms for $\ell_p$ norms, can also be applied in row sampling
  algorithms for a variety of loss functions. We complement our theoretical results
  by experiments to demonstrate the practicality of our approach.
