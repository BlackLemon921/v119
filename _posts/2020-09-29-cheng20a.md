abstract: We study the problem of high-dimensional robust mean estimation in the presence
  of a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. A recent line of work has provided
  sophisticated polynomial-time algorithms for this problem with dimension-independent
  error guarantees for a range of natural distribution families. In this work, we
  show that a natural non-convex formulation of the problem can be solved directly
  by gradient descent. Our approach leverages a novel structural lemma, roughly showing
  that any approximate stationary point of our non-convex objective gives a near-optimal
  solution to the underlying robust estimation task. Our work establishes an intriguing
  connection between algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics and non-convex
  optimization, which may have broader applications to other robust estimation tasks.
