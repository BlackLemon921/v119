abstract: Traditional differential privacy is independent of the data distribution.
  However, this is not well-matched with the modern machine learning context, where
  models are trained on specific data. As a result, achieving meaningful privacy guarantees
  in ML often excessively reduces accuracy. We propose Bayesian differential privacy
  (BDP), which takes into account the data distribution to provide more practical
  privacy guarantees. We also derive a general privacy accounting method under BDP,
  building upon the well-known moments accountant. Our experiments demonstrate that
  in-distribution samples in classic machine learning datasets, such as MNIST and
  CIFAR-10, enjoy significantly stronger privacy guarantees than postulated by DP,
  while models maintain high classification accuracy.
