abstract: A fundamental problem in computational chemistry is to find a set of reactants
  to synthesize a target molecule, a.k.a. retrosynthesis prediction. Existing state-of-the-art
  methods rely on matching the target molecule with a large set of reaction templates,
  which are very computationally expensive and also suffer from the problem of coverage.
  In this paper, we propose a novel template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming
  a target molecular graph into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits
  the target molecular graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers,
  and then translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational
  graph translation framework. Experimental results show that G2Gs significantly outperforms
  existing template-free approaches by up to 63% in terms of the top-1 accuracy and
  achieves a performance close to that of state-of-the-art template-based approaches,
  but does not require domain knowledge and is much more scalable.
