abstract: 'It is still common to use Q-learning and temporal difference (TD) learning{—}even
  though they have divergence issues and sound Gradient TD alternatives exist{—}because
  divergence seems rare and they typically perform well. However, recent work with
  large neural network learning systems reveals that instability is more common than
  previously thought. Practitioners face a difficult dilemma: choose an easy to use
  and performant TD method, or a more complex algorithm that is more sound but harder
  to tune and all but unexplored with non-linear function approximation or control.
  In this paper, we introduce a new method called TD with Regularized Corrections
  (TDRC), that attempts to balance ease of use, soundness, and performance. It behaves
  as well as TD, when TD performs well, but is sound in cases where TD diverges. We
  empirically investigate TDRC across a range of problems, for both prediction and
  control, and for both linear and non-linear function approximation, and show, potentially
  for the first time, that Gradient TD methods could be a better alternative to TD
  and Q-learning.'
