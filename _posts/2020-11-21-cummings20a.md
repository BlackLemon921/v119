abstract: The change-point detection problem seeks to identify distributional changes
  in streams of data. Increasingly, tools for change-point detection are applied in
  settings where data may be highly sensitive and formal privacy guarantees are required,
  such as identifying disease outbreaks based on hospital records, or IoT devices
  detecting activity within a home. Differential privacy has emerged as a powerful
  technique for enabling data analysis while preventing information leakage about
  individuals. Much of the prior work on change-point detection{—}including the only
  private algorithms for this problem{—}requires complete knowledge of the pre-change
  and post-change distributions, which is an unrealistic assumption for many practical
  applications of interest. This work develops differentially private algorithms for
  solving the change-point detection problem when the data distributions are unknown.
  Additionally, the data may be sampled from distributions that change smoothly over
  time, rather than fixed pre-change and post-change distributions. We apply our algorithms
  to detect changes in the linear trends of such data streams. Finally, we also provide
  experimental results to empirically validate the performance of our algorithms.
