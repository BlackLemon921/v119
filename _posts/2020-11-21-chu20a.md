abstract: Distance metric learning (DML) is to learn a representation space equipped
  with a metric, such that similar examples are closer than dissimilar examples concerning
  the metric. The recent success of DNNs motivates many DML losses that encourage
  the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The trade-off between
  inter-class compactness and inter-class separability shapes the DML representation
  space by determining how much information of the original inputs to retain. In this
  paper, we propose a Distance Metric Learning with Joint Representation Diversification
  (JRD) that allows a better balancing point between intra-class compactness and inter-class
  separability. Specifically, we propose a Joint Representation Similarity regularizer
  that captures different abstract levels of invariant features and diversifies the
  joint distributions of representations across multiple layers. Experiments on three
  deep DML benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
