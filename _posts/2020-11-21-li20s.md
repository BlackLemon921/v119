abstract: In this work, we propose a robust test for the multivariate two-sample problem
  through projective ensemble, which is a generalization of the Cramer-von Mises statistic.
  The proposed test statistic has a simple closed-form expression without any tuning
  parameters involved, it is easy to implement can be computed in quadratic time.
  Moreover, our test is insensitive to the dimension and consistent against all fixed
  alternatives, it does not require the moment assumption and is robust to the presence
  of outliers. We study the asymptotic behaviors of the test statistic under the null
  and two kinds of alternative hypotheses. We also suggest a permutation procedure
  to approximate critical values and employ its consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our test through extensive simulation studies and a real data application.
