abstract: We study generalization properties of weakly supervised learning, that is,
  learning where only a few "strong" labels (the actual target for prediction) are
  present but many more "weak" labels are available. In particular, we show that pretraining
  using weak labels and finetuning using strong can accelerate the learning rate for
  the strong task to the fast rate of O(1/n), where n is the number of strongly labeled
  data points. This acceleration can happen even if, by itself, the strongly labeled
  data admits only the slower O(1/\sqrt{n}) rate. The acceleration depends continuously
  on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks.
  Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate
  how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task.
