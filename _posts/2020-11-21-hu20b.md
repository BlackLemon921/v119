abstract: Much recent progress in applications of machine learning models to NLP has
  been driven by benchmarks that evaluate models across a wide variety of tasks. However,
  these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English, and despite
  an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that enables the comprehensive
  evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of languages and tasks is still missing.
  To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual
  Encoders (XTREME) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual
  generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages
  and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance
  on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually
  transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There
  is also a wide spread of results across languages. We will release the benchmark
  to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer linguistic
  knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and tasks.
