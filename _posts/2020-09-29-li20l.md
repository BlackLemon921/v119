abstract: Tensor network (TN) decomposition is a promising framework to represent
  extremely high-dimensional problems with few parameters. However, it is challenging
  to search the (near-)optimal topological structures for TN decomposition, since
  the number of candidate solutions exponentially grows with increasing the order
  of a tensor. In this paper, we claim that the issue can be practically tackled by
  evolutionary algorithms in an affordable manner. We encode the complex topological
  structures into binary strings, and develop a simple genetic meta-algorithm to search
  the optimal topology on Hamming space. The experimental results by both synthetic
  and real-world data demonstrate that our method can effectively discover the ground-truth
  topology or even better structures with a small number of generations, and significantly
  boost the representational power of TN decomposition compared with well-known tensor-train
  (TT) or tensor-ring (TR) models.
