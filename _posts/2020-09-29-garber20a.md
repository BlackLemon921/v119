abstract: "Online Convex Optimization (OCO) is a powerful framework for sequential
  prediction, portraying the natural uncertainty inherent in data-streams as though
  the data were generated by an almost omniscient adversary. However, this view, which
  is often too pessimistic for real-world data, comes with a price. The complexity
  of solving many important online tasks in this adversarial framework becomes much
  worse than that of their offline and even stochastic counterparts. In this work
  we consider a natural random-order version of the OCO model, in which the adversary
  can choose the set of loss functions, but does not get to choose the order in which
  they are supplied to the learner; Instead, they are observed in uniformly random
  order. \tFocusing on two important families of online tasks, one in which the cumulative
  loss function is strongly convex (though individual loss functions may not even
  be convex), and the other being online $k$-PCA, we show that under standard well-conditioned-data
  assumptions, standard online gradient descent (OGD) methods become much more efficient
  in the random-order model. In particular, for the first group of tasks OGD guarantees
  poly-logarithmic regret. In the case of online $k$-PCA, OGD guarantees sublinear
  regret using only a rank-$k$ SVD on each iteration and memory linear in the size
  of the solution."
