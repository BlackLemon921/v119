abstract: We study the problem of differentially private query release assisted by
  access to public data. In this problem, the goal is to answer a large class $\mathcal{H}$
  of statistical queries with error no more than $\alpha$ using a combination of public
  and private samples. The algorithm is required to satisfy differential privacy only
  with respect to the private samples. We study the limits of this task in terms of
  the private and public sample complexities. Our upper and lower bounds on the private
  sample complexity have matching dependence on the dual VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}$.
  For a large category of query classes, our bounds on the public sample complexity
  have matching dependence on $\alpha$.
