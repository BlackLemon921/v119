abstract: 'We derive analytical expressions for the generalization performance of
  kernel regression as a function of the number of training samples using theoretical
  methods from Gaussian processes and statistical physics. Our expressions apply to
  wide neural networks due to an equivalence between training them and kernel regression
  with the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). By computing the decomposition of the total
  generalization error due to different spectral components of the kernel, we identify
  a new spectral principle: as the size of the training set grows, kernel machines
  and neural networks fit successively higher spectral modes of the target function.
  When data are sampled from a uniform distribution on a high-dimensional hypersphere,
  dot product kernels, including NTK, exhibit learning stages where different frequency
  modes of the target function are learned. We verify our theory with simulations
  on synthetic data and MNIST dataset.'
