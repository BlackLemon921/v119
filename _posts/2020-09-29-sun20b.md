abstract: In this paper, we propose Test-Time Training, a general approach for improving
  the performance of predictive models when training and test data come from different
  distributions. We turn a single unlabeled test sample into a self-supervised learning
  problem, on which we update the model parameters before making a prediction. This
  also extends naturally to data in an online stream. Our simple approach leads to
  improvements on diverse image classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness
  to distribution shifts.
