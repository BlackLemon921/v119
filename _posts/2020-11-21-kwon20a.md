abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) attempts to learn
  a model that minimizes the local worst-case risk in the vicinity of the empirical
  data distribution defined by Wasserstein ball. While WDRO has received attention
  as a promising tool for inference since its introduction, its theoretical understanding
  has not been fully matured. Gao et al. (2017) proposed a minimizer based on a tractable
  approximation of the local worst-case risk, but without showing risk consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a minimizer based on a novel approximation theorem and
  provide the corresponding risk consistency results. Furthermore, we develop WDRO
  inference for locally perturbed data that include the Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017)
  as a special case. We show that our approximation and risk consistency results naturally
  extend to the cases when data are locally perturbed. Numerical experiments demonstrate
  robustness of the proposed method using image classification datasets. Our results
  show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy than baseline
  models on noisy datasets.
