abstract: Models that employ latent variables to capture structure in observed data
  lie at the heart of many current unsupervised learning algorithms, but exact maximum-likelihood
  learning for powerful and flexible latent-variable models is almost always intractable.
  Thus, state-of-the-art approaches either abandon the maximum-likelihood framework
  entirely, or else rely on a variety of variational approximations to the posterior
  distribution over the latents. Here, we propose an alternative approach that we
  call amortised learning. Rather than computing an approximation to the posterior
  over latents, we use a wake-sleep Monte-Carlo strategy to learn a function that
  directly estimates the maximum-likelihood parameter updates. Amortised learning
  is possible whenever samples of latents and observations can be simulated from the
  generative model, treating the model as a “black box”. We demonstrate its effectiveness
  on a wide range of complex models, including those with latents that are discrete
  or supported on non-Euclidean spaces.
