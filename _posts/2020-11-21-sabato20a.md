abstract: We consider the study of a classification model whose properties are impossible
  to estimate using a validation set, either due to the absence of such a set or because
  access to the classifier, even as a black-box, is impossible. Instead, only aggregate
  statistics on the rate of positive predictions in each of several sub-populations
  are available, as well as the true rates of positive labels in each of these sub-populations.
  We show that these aggregate statistics can be used to lower-bound the discrepancy
  of a classifier, which is a measure that balances inaccuracy and unfairness. To
  this end, we define a new measure of unfairness, equal to the fraction of the population
  on which the classifier behaves differently, compared to its global, ideally fair
  behavior, as defined by the measure of equalized odds. We propose an efficient and
  practical procedure for finding the best possible lower bound on the discrepancy
  of the classifier, given the aggregate statistics, and demonstrate in experiments
  the empirical tightness of this lower bound, as well as its possible uses on various
  types of problems, ranging from estimating the quality of voting polls to measuring
  the effectiveness of patient identification from internet search queries. The code
  and data are available at https://github.com/sivansabato/bfa.
