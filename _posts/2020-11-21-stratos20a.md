abstract: We propose learning discrete structured representations from unlabeled data
  by maximizing the mutual information between a structured latent variable and a
  target variable. Calculating mutual information is intractable in this setting.
  Our key technical contribution is an adversarial objective that can be used to tractably
  estimate mutual information assuming only the feasibility of cross entropy calculation.
  We develop a concrete realization of this general formulation with Markov distributions
  over binary encodings. We report critical and unexpected findings on practical aspects
  of the objective such as the choice of variational priors. We apply our model on
  document hashing and show that it outperforms current best baselines based on discrete
  and vector quantized variational autoencoders. It also yields highly compressed
  interpretable representations.
