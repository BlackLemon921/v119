abstract: Maximum selection under probabilistic queries \emph{(probabilistic maximization)}
  is a fundamental algorithmic problem arising in numerous theoretical and practical
  contexts. We derive the first query-optimal sequential algorithm for probabilistic-maximization.
  Departing from previous assumptions, the algorithm and performance guarantees apply
  even for infinitely many items, hence in particular do not require a-priori knowledge
  of the number of items. The algorithm has linear query complexity, and is optimal
  also in the streaming setting. To derive these results we consider a probabilistic
  setting where several candidates for a position are asked multiple questions with
  the goal of finding who has the highest probability of answering interview questions
  correctly. Previous work minimized the total number of questions asked by alternating
  back and forth between the best performing candidates, in a sense, inviting them
  to multiple interviews. We show that the same order-wise selection accuracy can
  be achieved by querying the candidates sequentially, never returning to a previously
  queried candidate. Hence one interview is enough!
