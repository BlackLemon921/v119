abstract: Training multiple tasks jointly in one deep network yields reduced latency
  during inference and better performance over the single-task counterpart by sharing
  certain layers of a network. However, over-sharing a network could erroneously enforce
  over-generalization, causing negative knowledge transfer across tasks. Prior works
  rely on human intuition or pre-computed task relatedness scores for ad hoc branching
  structures. They provide sub-optimal end results and often require huge efforts
  for the trial-and-error process. In this work, we present an automated multi-task
  learning algorithm that learns where to share or branch within a network, designing
  an effective network topology that is directly optimized for multiple objectives
  across tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel tree-structured design space that
  casts a tree branching operation as a gumbel-softmax sampling procedure. This enables
  differentiable network splitting that is end-to-end trainable. We validate the proposed
  method on controlled synthetic data, CelebA, and Taskonomy.
