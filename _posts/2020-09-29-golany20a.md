abstract: 'Generating training examples for supervised tasks is a long sought after
  goal in AI. We study the problem of heart signal electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis
  for improved heartbeat classification. ECG synthesis is challenging: the generation
  of training examples for such biological-physiological systems is not straightforward,
  due to their dynamic nature in which the various parts of the system interact in
  complex ways. However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for
  years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate
  this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator
  for the task of ECG classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential
  equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the
  optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically
  plausible ECG training examples. We perform empirical evaluation and show that heart
  simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG classification.'
