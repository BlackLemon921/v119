abstract: Posterior distribution approximation is a central task in Bayesian inference.
  Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and its extensions have been practically
  used and theoretically studied. While SGLD updates a single particle at a time,
  ensemble methods that update multiple particles simultaneously have been recently
  gathering attention. Compared with the naive parallel-chain SGLD that updates multiple
  particles independently, ensemble methods update particles with their interactions.
  Thus, these methods are expected to be more particle-efficient than the naive parallel-chain
  SGLD because particles can be aware of other particlesâ€™ behavior through their interactions.
  Although ensemble methods numerically demonstrated their superior performance, no
  theoretical guarantee exists to assure such particle-efficiency and it is unclear
  whether those ensemble methods are really superior to the naive parallel-chain SGLD
  in the non-asymptotic settings. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel ensemble
  method that uses a non-reversible Markov chain for the interaction, and we present
  a non-asymptotic theoretical analysis for our method. Our analysis shows that, for
  the first time, the interaction causes a faster convergence rate than the naive
  parallel-chain SGLD in the non-asymptotic setting if the discretization error is
  appropriately controlled. Numerical experiments show that we can control the discretization
  error by tuning the interaction appropriately.
