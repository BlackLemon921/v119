abstract: Generalization across environments is critical to the successful application
  of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world challenges. In this work
  we propose a method for learning state abstractions which generalize to novel observation
  distributions in the multi-environment RL setting. We prove that for certain classes
  of environments, this approach outputs, with high probability, a state abstraction
  corresponding to the causal feature set with respect to the return. We give empirical
  evidence that analogous methods for the nonlinear setting can also attain improved
  generalization over single- and multi-task baselines. Lastly, we provide bounds
  on model generalization error in the multi-environment setting, in the process showing
  a connection between causal variable identification and the state abstraction framework
  for MDPs.
