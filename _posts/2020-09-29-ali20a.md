abstract: We study the implicit regularization of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent,
  when applied to the fundamental problem of least squares regression. We leverage
  a continuous-time stochastic differential equation having the same moments as stochastic
  gradient descent, which we call stochastic gradient flow. We give a bound on the
  excess risk of stochastic gradient flow at time $t$, over ridge regression with
  tuning parameter $\lambda = 1/t$. The bound may be computed from explicit constants
  (e.g., the mini-batch size, step size, number of iterations), revealing precisely
  how these quantities drive the excess risk. Numerical examples show the bound can
  be small, indicating a tight relationship between the two estimators. We give a
  similar result relating the coefficients of stochastic gradient flow and ridge.
  These results hold under no conditions on the data matrix $X$, and across the entire
  optimization path (not just at convergence).
