abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are nonparametric Bayesian models that have been
  applied to regression and classification problems. One of the approaches to alleviate
  their cubic training cost is the use of local GP experts trained on subsets of the
  data. In particular, product-of-expert models combine the predictive distributions
  of local experts through a tractable product operation. While these expert models
  allow for massively distributed computation, their predictions typically suffer
  from erratic behaviour of the mean or uncalibrated uncertainty quantification. By
  calibrating predictions via a tempered softmax weighting, we provide a solution
  to these problems for multiple product-of-expert models, including the generalised
  product of experts and the robust Bayesian committee machine. Furthermore, we leverage
  the optimal transport literature and propose a new product-of-expert model that
  combines predictions of local experts by computing their Wasserstein barycenter,
  which can be applied to both regression and classification.
