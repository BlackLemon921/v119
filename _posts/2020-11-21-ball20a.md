abstract: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) offers a promising direction for
  sample efficient learning, often achieving state of the art results for continuous
  control tasks. However many existing MBRL methods rely on combining greedy policies
  with exploration heuristics, and even those which utilize principled exploration
  bonuses construct dual objectives in an ad hoc fashion. In this paper we introduce
  Ready Policy One (RP1), a framework that views MBRL as an active learning problem,
  where we aim to improve the world model in the fewest samples possible. RP1 achieves
  this by utilizing a hybrid objective function, which crucially adapts during optimization,
  allowing the algorithm to trade off reward v.s. exploration at different stages
  of learning. In addition, we introduce a principled mechanism to terminate sample
  collection once we have a rich enough trajectory batch to improve the model. We
  rigorously evaluate our method on a variety of continuous control tasks, and demonstrate
  statistically significant gains over existing approaches.
