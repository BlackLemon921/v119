abstract: Normalizing flows are exact-likelihood generative neural networks which
  approximately transform samples from a simple prior distribution to samples of the
  probability distribution of interest. Recent work showed that such generative models
  can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body
  systems in physics and chemistry. To scale and generalize these results, it is essential
  that the natural symmetries in the probability density – in physics defined by the
  invariances of the target potential – are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical
  sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by equivariant normalizing
  flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose
  building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical
  many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics,
  we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization
  capabilities and sampling efficiency.
