abstract: 'We study a security threat to reinforcement learning where an attacker
  poisons the learning environment to force the agent into executing a target policy
  chosen by the attacker. As a victim, we consider RL agents whose objective is to
  find a policy that maximizes average reward in undiscounted infinite-horizon problem
  settings. The attacker can manipulate the rewards or the transition dynamics in
  the learning environment at training-time and is interested in doing so in a stealthy
  manner. We propose an optimization framework for finding an \emph{optimal stealthy
  attack} for different measures of attack cost. We provide sufficient technical conditions
  under which the attack is feasible and provide lower/upper bounds on the attack
  cost. We instantiate our attacks in two settings: (i) an \emph{offline} setting
  where the agent is doing planning in the poisoned environment, and (ii) an \emph{online}
  setting where the agent is learning a policy using a regret-minimization framework
  with poisoned feedback. Our results show that the attacker can easily succeed in
  teaching any target policy to the victim under mild conditions and highlight a significant
  security threat to reinforcement learning agents in practice.'
