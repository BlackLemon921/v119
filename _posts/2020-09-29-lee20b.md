abstract: We present a sparse representation of model uncertainty for Deep Neural
  Networks (DNNs) where the parameter posterior is approximated with an inverse formulation
  of the Multivariate Normal Distribution (MND), also known as the information form.
  The key insight of our work is that the information matrix, i.e. the inverse of
  the covariance matrix tends to be sparse in its spectrum. Therefore, dimensionality
  reduction techniques such as low rank approximations (LRA) can be effectively exploited.
  To achieve this, we develop a novel sparsification algorithm and derive a cost-effective
  analytical sampler. As a result, we show that the information form can be scalably
  applied to represent model uncertainty in DNNs. Our exhaustive theoretical analysis
  and empirical evaluations on various benchmarks show the competitiveness of our
  approach over the current methods.
