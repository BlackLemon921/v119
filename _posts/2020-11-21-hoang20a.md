abstract: Kernel selection for kernel-based methods is prohibitively expensive due
  to the NP-hard nature of discrete optimization. Since gradient-based optimizers
  are not applicable due to the lack of a differentiable objective function, many
  state-of-the-art solutions resort to heuristic search or gradient-free optimization.
  These approaches, however, require imposing restrictive assumptions on the explorable
  space of structures such as limiting the active candidate pool, thus depending heavily
  on the intuition of domain experts. This paper instead proposes \textbf{DTERGENS},
  a novel generative search framework that constructs and optimizes a high-performance
  composite kernel expressions generator. \textbf{DTERGENS} does not restrict the
  space of candidate kernels and is capable of obtaining flexible length expressions
  by jointly optimizing a generative termination criterion. We demonstrate that our
  framework explores more diverse kernels and obtains better performance than state-of-the-art
  approaches on many real-world predictive tasks.
