abstract: 'Finite-horizon sequential experimental design (SED) arises naturally in
  many contexts, including hyperparameter tuning in machine learning among more traditional
  settings. Computing the optimal policy for such problems requires solving Bellman
  equations, which are generally intractable. Most existing work resorts to severely
  myopic approximations by limiting the decision horizon to only a single time-step,
  which can underweight exploration in favor of exploitation. We present BINOCULARS:
  Batch-Informed NOnmyopic Choices, Using Long-horizons for Adaptive, Rapid SED, a
  general framework for deriving efficient, nonmyopic approximations to the optimal
  experimental policy. Our key idea is simple and surprisingly effective: we first
  compute a one-step optimal batch of experiments, then select a single point from
  this batch to evaluate. We realize BINOCULARS for Bayesian optimization and Bayesian
  quadrature – two notable example problems with radically different objectives –
  and demonstrate that BINOCULARS significantly outperforms significantly outperforms
  myopic alternatives in real-world scenarios.'
