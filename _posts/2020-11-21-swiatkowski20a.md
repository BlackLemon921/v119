abstract: Variational Bayesian Inference is a popular methodology for approximating
  posterior distributions over Bayesian neural network weights. Recent work developing
  this class of methods has explored ever richer parameterizations of the approximate
  posterior in the hope of improving performance. In contrast, here we share a curious
  experimental finding that suggests instead restricting the variational distribution
  to a more compact parameterization. For a variety of deep Bayesian neural networks
  trained using Gaussian mean-field variational inference, we find that the posterior
  standard deviations consistently exhibit strong low-rank structure after convergence.
  This means that by decomposing these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization,
  we can make our variational approximation more compact without decreasing the modelsâ€™
  performance. Furthermore, we find that such factorized parameterizations improve
  the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the variational lower
  bound, resulting in faster convergence.
