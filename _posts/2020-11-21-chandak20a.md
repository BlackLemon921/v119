abstract: Most reinforcement learning methods are based upon the key assumption that
  the transition dynamics and reward functions are fixed, that is, the underlying
  Markov decision process is stationary. However, in many real-world applications,
  this assumption is violated, and using existing algorithms may result in a performance
  lag. To proactively search for a good future policy, we present a policy gradient
  algorithm that maximizes a forecast of future performance. This forecast is obtained
  by fitting a curve to the counter-factual estimates of policy performance over time,
  without explicitly modeling the underlying non-stationarity. The resulting algorithm
  amounts to a non-uniform reweighting of past data, and we observe that minimizing
  performance over some of the data from past episodes can be beneficial when searching
  for a policy that maximizes future performance. We show that our algorithm, called
  Prognosticator, is more robust to non-stationarity than two online adaptation techniques,
  on three simulated problems motivated by real-world applications.
