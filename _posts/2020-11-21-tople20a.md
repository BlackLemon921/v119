abstract: 'Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks are known to be
  susceptible to privacy attacks such as membership inference where an adversary can
  detect whether a data point was used to train a model. Such privacy risks are exacerbated
  when a model is used for predictions on an unseen data distribution. To alleviate
  privacy attacks, we demonstrate the benefit of predictive models that are based
  on the causal relationships between input features and the outcome. We first show
  that models learnt using causal structure generalize better to unseen data, especially
  on data from different distributions than the train distribution. Based on this
  generalization property, we establish a theoretical link between causality and privacy:
  compared to associational models, causal models provide stronger differential privacy
  guarantees and are more robust to membership inference attacks. Experiments on simulated
  Bayesian networks and the colored-MNIST dataset show that associational models exhibit
  upto 80% attack accuracy under different test distributions and sample sizes whereas
  causal models exhibit attack accuracy close to a random guess.'
