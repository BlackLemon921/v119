abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has become an important approach to automatically
  find effective architectures. To cover all possible good architectures, we need
  to search in an extremely large search space with billions of candidate architectures.
  More critically, given a large search space, we may face a very challenging issue
  of space explosion. However, due to the limitation of computational resources, we
  can only sample a very small proportion of the architectures, which provides insufficient
  information for the training. As a result, existing methods may often produce sub-optimal
  architectures. To alleviate this issue, we propose a curriculum search method that
  starts from a small search space and gradually incorporates the learned knowledge
  to guide the search in a large space. With the proposed search strategy, our Curriculum
  Neural Architecture Search (CNAS) method significantly improves the search efficiency
  and finds better architectures than existing NAS methods. Extensive experiments
  on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
