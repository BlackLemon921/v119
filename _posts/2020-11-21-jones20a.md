abstract: The field of algorithms has seen a push for fairness, or the removal of
  inherent bias, in recent history. In data summarization, where a much smaller subset
  of a data set is chosen to represent the whole of the data, fairness can be introduced
  by guaranteeing each "demographic group" a specific portion of the representative
  subset. Specifically, this paper examines this fair variant of the k-centers problem,
  where a subset of the data with cardinality k is chosen to minimize distance to
  the rest of the data. Previous papers working on this problem presented both a 3-approximation
  algorithm with a super-linear runtime and a linear-time algorithm whose approximation
  factor is exponential in the number of demographic groups. This paper combines the
  best of each algorithm by presenting a linear-time algorithm with a guaranteed 3-approximation
  factor and provides empirical evidence of both the algorithmâ€™s runtime and effectiveness.
