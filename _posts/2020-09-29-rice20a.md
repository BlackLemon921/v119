abstract: It is common practice in deep learning to use overparameterized networks
  and train for as long as possible; there are numerous studies that show, both theoretically
  and empirically, that such practices surprisingly do not unduly harm the generalization
  performance of the classifier. In this paper, we empirically study this phenomenon
  in the setting of adversarially trained deep networks, which are trained to minimize
  the loss under worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that overfitting to
  the training set does in fact harm robust performance to a very large degree in
  adversarially robust training across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
  and ImageNet) and perturbation models (L-infinity and L-2). Based upon this observed
  effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic improvements
  upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early stopping. We also
  show that effects such as the double descent curve do still occur in adversarially
  trained models, yet fail to explain the observed overfitting. Finally, we study
  several classical and modern deep learning remedies for overfitting, including regularization
  and data augmentation, and find that no approach in isolation improves significantly
  upon the gains achieved by early stopping. All code for reproducing the experiments
  as well as pretrained model weights and training logs can be found at https://github.com/
