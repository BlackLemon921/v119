abstract: In this paper we propose a scalable, unsupervised approach for detecting
  anomalies in the Internet of Things (IoT). Complex devices are connected daily and
  eagerly generate vast streams of multidimensional telemetry. These devices often
  operate in distinct modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant,
  etc.), and to prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize
  as early as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes.
  We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample
  from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish between
  positive and negative samples. Using the Concentration Phenomenon, we explain why
  such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries between normal
  and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can attribute the anomaly
  to specific dimensions within the anomalous state vector. We have demonstrated that
  negative sampling with random forest or neural network classifiers yield significantly
  higher AUC scores compared to state-of-the-art approaches against benchmark anomaly
  detection datasets, and a multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate
  control devices. Finally, we describe how negative sampling with neural network
  classifiers have been successfully deployed at large scale to predict failures in
  real time in over 15,000 climate-control and power meter devices in 145 office buildings
  within the California Bay Area.
