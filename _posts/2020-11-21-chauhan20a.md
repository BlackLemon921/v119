abstract: On a periodic basis, publicly traded companies report fundamentals, financial
  data including revenue, earnings, debt, among others. Quantitative finance research
  has identified several factors, functions of the reported data that historically
  correlate with stock market performance. In this paper, we first show through simulation
  that if we could select stocks via factors calculated on future fundamentals (via
  oracle), that our portfolios would far outperform standard factor models. Motivated
  by this insight, we train deep nets to forecast future fundamentals from a trailing
  5-year history. We propose lookahead factor models which plug these predicted future
  fundamentals into traditional factors. Finally, we incorporate uncertainty estimates
  from both neural heteroscedastic regression and a dropout-based heuristic, improving
  performance by adjusting our portfolios to avert risk. In retrospective analysis,
  we leverage an industry-grade portfolio simulator (backtester) to show simultaneous
  improvement in annualized return and Sharpe ratio. Specifically, the simulated annualized
  return for the uncertainty-aware model is 17.7% (vs 14.0% for a standard factor
  model) and the Sharpe ratio is 0.84 (vs 0.52).
