abstract: PageRank is a widely used approach for measuring the importance of a node
  in a graph. Due to the rapid growth of the graph size in the real world, the importance
  of computing PageRanks in a distributed environment has been increasingly recognized.
  However, only a few previous works can provide a provable complexity and accuracy
  for distributed PageRank computation. Given a constant $d\ge 1$ and a graph of $n$
  nodes, the state-of-the-art approach, Radar-Push, uses $O(\log\log{n}+\log{d})$
  communication rounds to approximate the PageRanks within a relative error $\Theta(\frac{1}{\log^d{n}})$
  under a generalized congested clique distributed computation model. However, Radar-Push
  entails as large as $O(\log^{2d+3}{n})$ bits of bandwidth (e.g., the communication
  cost between a pair of nodes per round). In this paper, we provide a new algorithm
  that uses asymptotically the same communication round complexity while using only
  $O(d\log^3{n})$ bits of bandwidth.
