abstract: Standard reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy that
  identifies the best action for each state. However, in healthcare settings, many
  actions may be near-equivalent with respect to the reward (e.g., survival). We consider
  an alternative objective â€“ learning set-valued policies to capture near-equivalent
  actions that lead to similar cumulative rewards. We propose a model-free algorithm
  based on temporal difference learning and a near-greedy heuristic for action selection.
  We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm, providing optimality
  guarantees and demonstrate our approach on simulated environments and a real clinical
  task. Empirically, the proposed algorithm exhibits good convergence properties and
  discovers meaningful near-equivalent actions. Our work provides theoretical, as
  well as practical, foundations for clinician/human-in-the-loop decision making,
  in which humans (e.g., clinicians, patients) can incorporate additional knowledge
  (e.g., side effects, patient preference) when selecting among near-equivalent actions.
