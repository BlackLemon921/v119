abstract: Graph matching, also known as network alignment, aims at recovering the
  latent vertex correspondence between two unlabeled, edge-correlated weighted graphs.
  To tackle this task, we propose a spectral method, GRAph Matching by Pairwise eigen-Alignments
  (GRAMPA), which first constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer
  products between all pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, and then outputs a
  matching by a simple rounding procedure. For a universality class of correlated
  Wigner models, GRAMPA achieves exact recovery of the latent matching between two
  graphs with edge correlation $1 - 1/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and average degree at least
  $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. This matches the state-of-the-art guarantees for polynomial-time
  algorithms established for correlated Erdős-Rényi graphs, and significantly improves
  over existing spectral methods. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on
  a variety of synthetic and real datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy
  and computational efficiency.
