abstract: We present the first provably convergent two-timescale off-policy actor-critic
  algorithm (COF-PAC) with function approximation. Key to COF-PAC is the introduction
  of a new critic, the emphasis critic, which is trained via Gradient Emphasis Learning
  (GEM), a novel combination of the key ideas of Gradient Temporal Difference Learning
  and Emphatic Temporal Difference Learning. With the help of the emphasis critic
  and the canonical value function critic, we show convergence for COF-PAC, where
  the critics are linear and the actor can be nonlinear.
