abstract: 'Universal probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) provide a powerful framework
  for specifying rich probabilistic models. They further attempt to automate the process
  of drawing inferences from these models, but doing this successfully is severely
  hampered by the wide range of nonâ€“standard models they can express. As a result,
  although one can specify complex models in a universal PPS, the provided inference
  engines often fall far short of what is required. In particular, we show that they
  produce surprisingly unsatisfactory performance for models where the support varies
  between executions, often doing no better than importance sampling from the prior.
  To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine,
  which remains efficient for such models, and show how it can be implemented as an
  automated and generic PPS inference engine. We empirically demonstrate substantial
  performance improvements over existing approaches on three examples.'
