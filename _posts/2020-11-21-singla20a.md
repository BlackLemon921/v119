abstract: A robustness certificate against adversarial examples is the minimum distance
  of a given input to the decision boundary of the classifier (or its lower bound).
  For \emph{any} perturbation of the input with a magnitude smaller than the certificate
  value, the classification output will provably remain unchanged. Computing exact
  robustness certificates for neural networks is difficult in general since it requires
  solving a non-convex optimization. In this paper, we provide computationally-efficient
  robustness certificates for neural networks with differentiable activation functions
  in two steps. First, we show that if the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the network
  (curvatures of the network) are bounded (globally or locally), we can compute a
  robustness certificate in the $l_2$ norm efficiently using convex optimization.
  Second, we derive a computationally-efficient differentiable upper bound on the
  curvature of a deep network. We also use the curvature bound as a regularization
  term during the training of the network to boost its certified robustness. Putting
  these results together leads to our proposed {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obustness
  {\bf C}ertificate (CRC) and {\bf C}urvature-based {\bf R}obust {\bf T}raining (CRT).
  Our numerical results show that CRT leads to significantly higher certified robust
  accuracy compared to interval-bound propagation based training.
