abstract: 'The sorting operation is one of the most commonly used building blocks
  in computer programming. In machine learning, it is often used for robust statistics.
  However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many
  kinks where it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator,
  often used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant
  function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works
  have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve
  the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations.
  In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators
  with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys
  exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable
  operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations,
  and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our
  approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two
  novel applications: differentiable Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient and least
  trimmed squares.'
