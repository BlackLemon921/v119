abstract: 'Safe reinforcement learning has been a promising approach for optimizing
  the policy of an agent that operates in safety-critical applications. In this paper,
  we propose an algorithm, SNO-MDP, that explores and optimizes Markov decision processes
  under unknown safety constraints. Specifically, we take a step-wise approach for
  optimizing safety and cumulative reward. In our method, the agent first learns safety
  constraints by expanding the safe region, and then optimizes the cumulative reward
  in the certified safe region. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the satisfaction
  of the safety constraint and the near-optimality of the cumulative reward under
  proper regularity assumptions. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of SNO-MDP through two experiments: one uses a synthetic data in a new, openly-available
  environment named GP-Safety-Gym, and the other simulates Mars surface exploration
  by using real observation data.'
