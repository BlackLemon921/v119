abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great empirical successes
  in various domains. However, the large search space of neural networks requires
  a large amount of data, which makes the current RL algorithms not sample efficient.
  Motivated by the fact that many environments with continuous state space have smooth
  transitions, we propose to learn a smooth policy that behaves smoothly with respect
  to states. We develop a new framework â€” \textbf{S}mooth \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{R}einforcement
  \textbf{L}earning ($\textbf{SR}^2\textbf{L}$), where the policy is trained with
  smoothness-inducing regularization. Such regularization effectively constrains the
  search space, and enforces smoothness in the learned policy. Moreover, our proposed
  framework can also improve the robustness of policy against measurement error in
  the state space, and can be naturally extended to distribubutionally robust setting.
  We apply the proposed framework to both on-policy (TRPO) and off-policy algorithm
  (DDPG). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves improved
  sample efficiency and robustness.
