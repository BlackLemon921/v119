abstract: In this work, we pose the question whether it is possible to design and
  train an autoencoder model in an end-to-end fashion to learn representations in
  the multivariate Bernoulli latent space, and achieve performance comparable with
  the state-of-the-art variational methods. Moreover, we investigate how to generate
  novel samples and perform smooth interpolation and attributes modification in the
  binary latent space. To meet our objective, we propose a simplified, deterministic
  model with a straight-through gradient estimator to learn the binary latents and
  show its competitiveness with the latest VAE methods. Furthermore, we propose a
  novel method based on a random hyperplane rounding for sampling and smooth interpolation
  in the latent space. Our method performs on a par or better than the current state-of-the-art
  methods on common CelebA, CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.
