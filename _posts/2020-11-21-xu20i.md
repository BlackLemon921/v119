abstract: We develop a functional encoder-decoder approach to supervised meta-learning,
  where labeled data is encoded into an infinite-dimensional functional representation
  rather than a finite-dimensional one. Furthermore, rather than directly producing
  the representation, we learn a neural update rule resembling functional gradient
  descent which iteratively improves the representation. The final representation
  is used to condition the decoder to make predictions on unlabeled data. Our approach
  is the first to demonstrates the success of encoder-decoder style meta-learning
  methods like conditional neural processes on large-scale few-shot classification
  benchmarks such as miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, where it achieves state-of-the-art
  performance.
