abstract: 'We give a local search based algorithm for $k$-median and $k$-means (and
  more generally for any $k$-clustering with $\ell_p$ norm cost function) from the
  perspective of individual fairness. More precisely, for a point $x$ in a point set
  $P$ of size $n$, let $r(x)$ be the minimum radius such that the ball of radius $r(x)$
  centered at $x$ has at least $n/k$ points from $P$. Intuitively, if a set of $k$
  random points are chosen from $P$ as centers, every point $x\in P$ expects to have
  a center within radius $r(x)$. In this work, we show how to get an approximately
  optimal such fair $k$-clustering: The $k$-median ($k$-means) cost of our solution
  is within a constant factor of the cost of an optimal fair $k$-clustering, and our
  solution approximately satisfies the fairness condition (also within a constant
  factor).'
