abstract: Particle-based Variational Inference methods (ParVIs), like Stein Variational
  Gradient Descent, are nonparametric variational inference methods that optimize
  a set of particles to best approximate a target distribution. ParVIs have been proposed
  as efficient approximate inference algorithms and as potential alternatives to MCMC
  methods. However, to our knowledge, the quality of the posterior approximation of
  particles from ParVIs has not been examined before for large-scale Bayesian inference
  problems. We conduct this analysis and evaluate the sample quality of particles
  produced by ParVIs, and we find that existing ParVI approaches using stochastic
  gradients converge insufficiently fast under sample quality metrics. We propose
  a novel variance reduction and quasi-Newton preconditioning framework for ParVIs,
  by leveraging the Riemannian structure of the Wasserstein space and advanced Riemannian
  optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the accelerated convergence
  of variance reduction and quasi-Newton methods for ParVIs for accurate posterior
  inference in large-scale and ill-conditioned problems.
