abstract: We address the problem of any-code completion - generating a missing piece
  of source code in a given program without any restriction on the vocabulary or structure.
  We introduce a new approach to any-code completion that leverages the strict syntax
  of programming languages to model a code snippet as a tree - structural language
  modeling (SLM). SLM estimates the probability of the programâ€™s abstract syntax tree
  (AST) by decomposing it into a product of conditional probabilities over its nodes.
  We present a neural model that computes these conditional probabilities by considering
  all AST paths leading to a target node. Unlike previous techniques that have severely
  restricted the kinds of expressions that can be generated in this task, our approach
  can generate arbitrary code in any programming language. Our model significantly
  outperforms both seq2seq and a variety of structured approaches in generating Java
  and C# code. Our code, data, and trained models are available at http://github.com/tech-srl/slm-code-generation/.
  An online demo is available at http://AnyCodeGen.org.
