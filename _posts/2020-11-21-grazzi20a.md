abstract: We study a general class of bilevel problems, consisting in the minimization
  of an upper-level objective which depends on the solution to a parametric fixed-point
  equation. Important instances arising in machine learning include hyperparameter
  optimization, meta-learning, and certain graph and recurrent neural networks. Typically
  the gradient of the upper-level objective (hypergradient) is hard or even impossible
  to compute exactly, which has raised the interest in approximation methods. We investigate
  some popular approaches to compute the hypergradient, based on reverse mode iterative
  differentiation and approximate implicit differentiation. Under the hypothesis that
  the fixed point equation is defined by a contraction mapping, we present a unified
  analysis which allows for the first time to quantitatively compare these methods,
  providing explicit bounds for their iteration complexity. This analysis suggests
  a hierarchy in terms of computational efficiency among the above methods, with approximate
  implicit differentiation based on conjugate gradient performing best. We present
  an extensive experimental comparison among the methods which confirm the theoretical
  findings.
