abstract: 'We study why overparameterization—increasing model size well beyond the
  point of zero training error—can hurt test error on minority groups despite improving
  average test error when there are spurious correlations in the data. Through simulations
  and experiments on two image datasets, we identify two key properties of the training
  data that drive this behavior: the proportions of majority versus minority groups,
  and the signal-to-noise ratio of the spurious correlations. We then analyze a linear
  setting and theoretically show how the inductive bias of models towards “memorizing”
  fewer examples can cause overparameterization to hurt. Our analysis leads to a counterintuitive
  approach of subsampling the majority group, which empirically achieves low minority
  error in the overparameterized regime, even though the standard approach of upweighting
  the minority fails. Overall, our results suggest a tension between using overparameterized
  models versus using all the training data for achieving low worst-group error.'
