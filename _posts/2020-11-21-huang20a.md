abstract: In the paper, we propose a class of efficient momentum-based policy gradient
  methods for the model-free reinforcement learning, which use adaptive learning rates
  and do not require any large batches. Specifically, we propose a fast important-sampling
  momentum-based policy gradient (IS-MBPG) method based on a new momentum-based variance
  reduced technique and the importance sampling technique. We also propose a fast
  Hessian-aided momentum-based policy gradient (HA-MBPG) method based on the momentum-based
  variance reduced technique and the Hessian-aided technique. Moreover, we prove that
  both the IS-MBPG and HA-MBPG methods reach the best known sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$
  for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the nonconcave performance function,
  which only require one trajectory at each iteration. In particular, we present a
  non-adaptive version of IS-MBPG method, i.e., IS-MBPG*, which also reaches the best
  known sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ without any large batches. In the
  experiments, we apply four benchmark tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  algorithms.
