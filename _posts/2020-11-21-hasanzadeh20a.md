abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive connection sampling in graph
  neural networks (GNNs) that generalizes existing stochastic regularization methods
  for training GNNs. The proposed framework not only alleviates over-smoothing and
  over-fitting tendencies of deep GNNs, but also enables learning with uncertainty
  in graph analytic tasks with GNNs. Instead of using fixed sampling rates or hand-tuning
  themas model hyperparameters in existing stochastic regularization methods, our
  adaptive connection sampling can be trained jointly with GNN model parameters in
  both global and local fashions. GNN training with adaptive connection sampling is
  shown to be mathematically equivalent to an efficient approximation of training
  BayesianGNNs. Experimental results with ablation studies on benchmark datasets validate
  that adaptively learning the sampling rate given graph training data is the key
  to boost the performance of GNNs in semi-supervised node classification, less prone
  to over-smoothing and over-fitting with more robust prediction.
