abstract: Linear networks provide valuable insights into the workings of neural networks
  in general. This paper identifies conditions under which the gradient flow provably
  trains a linear network, in spite of the non-strict saddle points present in the
  optimization landscape. This paper also provides the computational complexity of
  training linear networks with gradient flow. To achieve these results, this work
  develops a machinery to provably identify the stable set of gradient flow, which
  then enables us to improve over the state of the art in the literature of linear
  networks (Bah et al., 2019;Arora et al., 2018a). Crucially, our results appear to
  be the first to break away from the lazy training regime which has dominated the
  literature of neural networks. This work requires the network to have a layer with
  one neuron, which subsumes the networks with a scalar output, but extending the
  results of this theoretical work to all linear networks remains a challenging open
  problem.
