abstract: 'Deep models, while being extremely flexible and accurate, are surprisingly
  vulnerable to “small, imperceptible” perturbations known as adversarial attacks.
  While the majority of existing attacks focus on measuring perturbations under the
  $\ell_p$ metric, Wasserstein distance, which takes geometry in pixel space into
  account, has long been known to be a suitable metric for measuring image quality
  and has recently risen as a compelling alternative to the $\ell_p$ metric in adversarial
  attacks. However, constructing an effective attack under the Wasserstein metric
  is computationally much more challenging and calls for better optimization algorithms.
  We address this gap in two ways: (a) we develop an exact yet efficient projection
  operator to enable a stronger projected gradient attack; (b) we show that the Frank-Wolfe
  method equipped with a suitable linear minimization oracle works extremely fast
  under Wasserstein constraints. Our algorithms not only converge faster but also
  generate much stronger attacks. For instance, we decrease the accuracy of a residual
  network on CIFAR-10 to $3.4%$ within a Wasserstein perturbation ball of radius $0.005$,
  in contrast to $65.6%$ using the previous Wasserstein attack based on an \emph{approximate}
  projection operator. Furthermore, employing our stronger attacks in adversarial
  training significantly improves the robustness of adversarially trained models.'
