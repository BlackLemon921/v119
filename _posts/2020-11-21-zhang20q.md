abstract: Capturing the occurrence dynamics is crucial to predicting which type of
  events will happen next and when. A common method to do this is through Hawkes processes.
  To enhance their capacity, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been incorporated
  due to RNNsâ€™ successes in processing sequential data such as languages. Recent evidence
  suggests that self-attention is more competent than RNNs in dealing with languages.
  However, we are unaware of the effectiveness of self-attention in the context of
  Hawkes processes. This study aims to fill the gap by designing a self-attentive
  Hawkes process (SAHP). SAHP employs self-attention to summarise the influence of
  history events and compute the probability of the next event. One deficit of the
  conventional self-attention when applied to event sequences is that its positional
  encoding only considers the order of a sequence ignoring the time intervals between
  events. To overcome this deficit, we modify its encoding by translating time intervals
  into phase shifts of sinusoidal functions. Experiments on goodness-of-fit and prediction
  tasks show the improved capability of SAHP. Furthermore, SAHP is more interpretable
  than RNN-based counterparts because the learnt attention weights reveal contributions
  of one event type to the happening of another type. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first work that studies the effectiveness of self-attention in Hawkes
  processes.
