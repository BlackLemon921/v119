abstract: 'A fundamental task in kernel methods is to pick nodes and weights, so as
  to approximate a given function from an RKHS by the weighted sum of kernel translates
  located at the nodes. This is the crux of kernel density estimation, kernel quadrature,
  or interpolation from discrete samples. Furthermore, RKHSs offer a convenient mathematical
  and computational framework. We introduce and analyse continuous volume sampling
  (VS), the continuous counterpart -for choosing node locations- of a discrete distribution
  introduced in (Deshpande & Vempala, 2006). Our contribution is theoretical: we prove
  almost optimal bounds for interpolation and quadrature under VS. While similar bounds
  already exist for some specific RKHSs using ad-hoc node constructions, VS offers
  bounds that apply to any Mercer kernel and depend on the spectrum of the associated
  integration operator. We emphasize that, unlike previous randomized approaches that
  rely on regularized leverage scores or determinantal point processes, evaluating
  the pdf of VS only requires pointwise evaluations of the kernel. VS is thus naturally
  amenable to MCMC samplers.'
