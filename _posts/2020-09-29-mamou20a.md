abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown much empirical success in solving
  perceptual tasks across various cognitive modalities. While they are only loosely
  inspired by the biological brain, recent studies report considerable similarities
  between representations extracted from task-optimized DNNs and neural populations
  in the brain. DNNs have subsequently become a popular model class to infer computational
  principles underlying complex cognitive functions, and in turn, they have also emerged
  as a natural testbed for applying methods originally developed to probe information
  in neural populations. In this work, we utilize mean-field theoretic manifold analysis,
  a recent technique from computational neuroscience that connects geometry of feature
  representations with linear separability of classes, to analyze language representations
  from large-scale contextual embedding models. We explore representations from different
  model families (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, etc.) and find evidence for emergence of linguistic
  manifolds across layer depth (e.g., manifolds for part-of-speech tags), especially
  in ambiguous data (i.e, words with multiple part-of-speech tags, or part-of-speech
  classes including many words). In addition, we find that the emergence of linear
  separability in these manifolds is driven by a combined reduction of manifoldsâ€™
  radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.
