abstract: Joint filtering is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications
  in many different areas. Most existing algorithms solve this problem with a weighted
  averaging process to aggregate input pixels. However, the weight matrix of this
  process is often empirically designed and not robust to complex input. In this work,
  we propose to learn the weight matrix for joint image filtering. This is a challenging
  problem, as directly learning a large weight matrix is computationally intractable.
  To address this issue, we introduce the correlation of deep features to approximate
  the aggregation weights. However, this strategy only uses inner product for the
  weight matrix estimation, which limits the performance of the proposed algorithm.
  Therefore, we further propose to learn a nonlinear function to predict sparse residuals
  of the feature correlation matrix. Note that the proposed method essentially factorizes
  the weight matrix into a low-rank and a sparse matrix and then learn both of them
  simultaneously with deep neural networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
  algorithm compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide variety
  of joint filtering tasks.
