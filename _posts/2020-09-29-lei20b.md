abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a widely used framework for learning
  generative models. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), one of the most successful variants
  of GANs, require solving a minmax optimization problem to global optimality, but
  are in practice successfully trained using stochastic gradient descent-ascent. In
  this paper, we show that, when the generator is a one-layer network, stochastic
  gradient descent-ascent converges to a global solution with polynomial time and
  sample complexity.
