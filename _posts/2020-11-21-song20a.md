abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) variants approximately minimize divergences
  between the model and the data distribution using a discriminator. Wasserstein GANs
  (WGANs) enjoy superior empirical performance, however, unlike in f-GANs, the discriminator
  does not provide an estimate for the ratio between model and data densities, which
  is useful in applications such as inverse reinforcement learning. To overcome this
  limitation, we propose an new training objective where we additionally optimize
  over a set of importance weights over the generated samples. By suitably constraining
  the feasible set of importance weights, we obtain a family of objectives which includes
  and generalizes the original f-GAN and WGAN objectives. We show that a natural extension
  outperforms WGANs while providing density ratios as in f-GAN, and demonstrate empirical
  success on distribution modeling, density ratio estimation and image generation.
