abstract: We study reward maximisation in a wide class of structured stochastic multi-armed
  bandit problems, where the mean rewards of arms satisfy some given structural constraints,
  e.g. linear, unimodal, sparse, etc. Our aim is to develop methods that are \emph{flexible}
  (in that they easily adapt to different structures), \emph{powerful} (in that they
  perform well empirically and/or provably match instance-dependent lower bounds)
  and \emph{efficient} in that the per-round computational burden is small. We develop
  asymptotically optimal algorithms from instance-dependent lower-bounds using iterative
  saddle-point solvers. Our approach generalises recent iterative methods for pure
  exploration to reward maximisation, where a major challenge arises from the estimation
  of the sub-optimality gaps and their reciprocals. Still we manage to achieve all
  the above desiderata. Notably, our technique avoids the computational cost of the
  full-blown saddle point oracle employed by previous work, while at the same time
  enabling finite-time regret bounds. Our experiments reveal that our method successfully
  leverages the structural assumptions, while its regret is at worst comparable to
  that of vanilla UCB.
