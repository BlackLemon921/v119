abstract: 'Many large-scale machine learning (ML) applications need to perform decentralized
  learning over datasets generated at different devices and locations. Such datasets
  pose a significant challenge to decentralized learning because their different contexts
  result in significant data distribution skew across devices/locations. In this paper,
  we take a step toward better understanding this challenge by presenting a detailed
  experimental study of decentralized DNN training on a common type of data skew:
  skewed distribution of data labels across devices/locations. Our study shows that:
  (i) skewed data labels are a fundamental and pervasive problem for decentralized
  learning, causing significant accuracy loss across many ML applications, DNN models,
  training datasets, and decentralized learning algorithms; (ii) the problem is particularly
  challenging for DNN models with batch normalization; and (iii) the degree of data
  skew is a key determinant of the difficulty of the problem. Based on these findings,
  we present SkewScout, a system-level approach that adapts the communication frequency
  of decentralized learning algorithms to the (skew-induced) accuracy loss between
  data partitions. We also show that group normalization can recover much of the accuracy
  loss of batch normalization.'
