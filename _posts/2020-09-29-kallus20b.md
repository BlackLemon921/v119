abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning allows one to evaluate
  novel decision policies without needing to conduct exploration, which is often costly
  or otherwise infeasible. We consider for the first time the semiparametric efficiency
  limits of OPE in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where actions, rewards, and states
  are memoryless. We show existing OPE estimators may fail to be efficient in this
  setting. We develop a new estimator based on cross-fold estimation of $q$-functions
  and marginalized density ratios, which we term double reinforcement learning (DRL).
  We show that DRL is efficient when both components are estimated at fourth-root
  rates and is also doubly robust when only one component is consistent. We investigate
  these properties empirically and demonstrate the performance benefits due to harnessing
  memorylessness.
