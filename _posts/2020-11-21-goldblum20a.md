abstract: Meta-learning algorithms produce feature extractors which achieve state-of-the-art
  performance on few-shot classification. While the literature is rich with meta-learning
  methods, little is known about why the resulting feature extractors perform so well.
  We develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of meta-learning and
  the difference between models trained using meta-learning and models which are trained
  classically. In doing so, we introduce and verify several hypotheses for why meta-learned
  models perform better. Furthermore, we develop a regularizer which boosts the performance
  of standard training routines for few-shot classification. In many cases, our routine
  outperforms meta-learning while simultaneously running an order of magnitude faster.
