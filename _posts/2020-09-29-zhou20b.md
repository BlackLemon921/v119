abstract: Monocular multi-object detection and localization in 3D space has been proven
  to be a challenging task. The MoNet3D algorithm is a novel and effective framework
  that can predict the 3D position of each object in a monocular image, and draw a
  3D bounding box on each object. The MoNet3D method incorporates the prior knowledge
  of spatial geometric correlation of neighboring objects into the deep neural network
  training process, in order to improve the accuracy of 3D object localization. Experiments
  over the KITTI data set show that the accuracy of predicting the depth and horizontal
  coordinate of the object in 3D space can reach 96.25% and 94.74%, respectively.
  Meanwhile, the method can realize the real-time image processing capability of 27.85
  FPS. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CQUlearningsystemgroup/YicongPeng
