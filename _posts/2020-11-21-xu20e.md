abstract: We propose a new algorithmic framework for learning autoencoders of data
  distributions. In this framework, we minimize the discrepancy between the model
  distribution and the target one, with relational regularization on learnable latent
  prior. This regularization penalizes the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance
  between the latent prior and its corresponding posterior, which allows us to learn
  a structured prior distribution associated with the generative model in a flexible
  way. Moreover, it helps us co-train multiple autoencoders even if they are with
  heterogeneous architectures and incomparable latent spaces. We implement the framework
  with two scalable algorithms, making it applicable for both probabilistic and deterministic
  autoencoders. Our relational regularized autoencoder (RAE) outperforms existing
  methods, e.g., variational autoencoder, Wasserstein autoencoder, and their variants,
  on generating images. Additionally, our relational co-training strategy of autoencoders
  achieves encouraging results in both synthesis and real-world multi-view learning
  tasks.
