abstract: In this work, we propose WaveFlow, a small-footprint generative flow for
  raw audio, which is directly trained with maximum likelihood. It handles the long-range
  structure of 1-D waveform with a dilated 2-D convolutional architecture, while modeling
  the local variations using expressive autoregressive functions. WaveFlow provides
  a unified view of likelihood-based models for 1-D data, including WaveNet and WaveGlow
  as special cases. It generates high-fidelity speech as WaveNet, while synthesizing
  several orders of magnitude faster as it only requires a few sequential steps to
  generate very long waveforms with hundreds of thousands of time-steps. Furthermore,
  it can significantly reduce the likelihood gap that has existed between autoregressive
  models and flow-based models for efficient synthesis. Finally, our small-footprint
  WaveFlow has only 5.91M parameters, which is 15{\texttimes} smaller than WaveGlow.
  It can generate 22.05 kHz high-fidelity audio 42.6{\texttimes} faster than real-time
  (at a rate of 939.3 kHz) on a V100 GPU without engineered inference kernels.
