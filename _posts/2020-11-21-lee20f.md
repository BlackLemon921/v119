abstract: Most real-world tasks are compound tasks that consist of multiple simpler
  sub-tasks. The main challenge of learning compound tasks is that we have no explicit
  supervision to learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. To address this
  challenge, previous imitation learning methods exploit task-specific knowledge,
  e.g., labeling demonstrations manually or specifying termination conditions for
  each sub-task. However, the need for task-specific knowledge makes it difficult
  to scale imitation learning to real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose an imitation
  learning method that can learn compound tasks without task-specific knowledge. The
  key idea behind our method is to leverage a self-supervised learning framework to
  learn the hierarchical structure of compound tasks. Our work also proposes a task-agnostic
  regularization technique to prevent unstable switching between sub-tasks, which
  has been a common degenerate case in previous works. We evaluate our method against
  several baselines on compound tasks. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on compound tasks, outperforming prior imitation learning methods.
