abstract: 'We propose a novel variant of SGD customized for training network architectures
  that support anytime behavior: such networks produce a series of increasingly accurate
  outputs over time. Efficient architectural designs for these networks focus on re-using
  internal state; subnetworks must produce representations relevant for both imme-
  diate prediction as well as refinement by subse- quent network stages. We consider
  traditional branched networks as well as a new class of re- cursively nested networks.
  Our new optimizer, Orthogonalized SGD, dynamically re-balances task-specific gradients
  when training a multitask network. In the context of anytime architectures, this
  optimizer projects gradients from later out- puts onto a parameter subspace that
  does not in- terfere with those from earlier outputs. Experi- ments demonstrate
  that training with Orthogonal- ized SGD significantly improves generalization accuracy
  of anytime networks.'
