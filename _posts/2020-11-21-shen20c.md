abstract: Generative autoencoders offer a promising approach for controllable text
  generation by leveraging their learned sentence representations. However, current
  models struggle to maintain coherent latent spaces required to perform meaningful
  text manipulations via latent vector operations. Specifically, we demonstrate by
  example that neural encoders do not necessarily map similar sentences to nearby
  latent vectors. A theoretical explanation for this phenomenon establishes that high-capacity
  autoencoders can learn an arbitrary mapping between sequences and associated latent
  representations. To remedy this issue, we augment adversarial autoencoders with
  a denoising objective where original sentences are reconstructed from perturbed
  versions (referred to as DAAE). We prove that this simple modification guides the
  latent space geometry of the resulting model by encouraging the encoder to map similar
  texts to similar latent representations. In empirical comparisons with various types
  of autoencoders, our model provides the best trade-off between generation quality
  and reconstruction capacity. Moreover, the improved geometry of the DAAE latent
  space enables \emph{zero-shot} text style transfer via simple latent vector arithmetic.
