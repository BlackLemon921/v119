abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) achieves significant empirical
  successes. However, MARL suffers from the curse of many agents. In this paper, we
  exploit the symmetry of agents in MARL. In the most generic form, we study a mean-field
  MARL problem. Such a mean-field MARL is defined on mean-field states, which are
  distributions that are supported on continuous space. Based on the mean embedding
  of the distributions, we propose MF-FQI algorithm, which solves the mean-field MARL
  and establishes a non-asymptotic analysis for MF-FQI algorithm. We highlight that
  MF-FQI algorithm enjoys a “blessing of many agents” property in the sense that a
  larger number of observed agents improves the performance of MF-FQI algorithm.
