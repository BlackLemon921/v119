abstract: While deep neural networks achieve great performance on fitting the training
  distribution, the learned networks are prone to overfitting and are susceptible
  to adversarial attacks. In this regard, a number of mixup based augmentation methods
  have been recently proposed. However, these approaches mainly focus on creating
  previously unseen virtual examples and can sometimes provide misleading supervisory
  signal to the network. To this end, we propose Puzzle Mix, a mixup method for explicitly
  utilizing the saliency information and the underlying statistics of the natural
  examples. This leads to an interesting optimization problem alternating between
  the multi-label objective for optimal mixing mask and saliency discounted optimal
  transport objective. Our experiments show Puzzle Mix achieves the state of the art
  generalization and the adversarial robustness results compared to other mixup methods
  on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, and the source code is available
  at https://github.com/snu-mllab/PuzzleMix.
