abstract: Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously
  difficult, though crucial for obtaining the best accuracy. The most popular hyperparameter
  optimization approach is grid-search on a held-out dataset. However, grid-search
  requires to choose a predefined grid of parameters and scales exponentially in the
  number of parameters. Another class of approaches casts hyperparameter optimization
  as a bi-level optimization problem, typically solved by gradient descent. The key
  challenge for these approaches is the estimation of the gradient w.r.t. the hyperparameters.
  Computing that gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation usually
  suffers from high memory consumption, while implicit differentiation typically involves
  solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable. In addition,
  implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the
  case of Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation
  algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our proposal
  scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Empirically,
  we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods
  for hyperparameter optimization.
