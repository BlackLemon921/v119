abstract: In this work, we give a new parallel algorithm for the problem of maximizing
  a non-monotone diminishing returns submodular function subject to a cardinality
  constraint. For any desired accuracy $\epsilon$, our algorithm achieves a $1/e -
  \epsilon$ approximation using $O(\log{n} \log(1/\epsilon) / \epsilon^3)$ parallel
  rounds of function evaluations. The approximation guarantee nearly matches the best
  approximation guarantee known for the problem in the sequential setting and the
  number of parallel rounds is nearly-optimal for any constant $\epsilon$. Previous
  algorithms achieve worse approximation guarantees using $\Omega(\log^2{n})$ parallel
  rounds. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our algorithm obtains solutions
  whose objective value nearly matches the value obtained by the state of the art
  sequential algorithms, and it outperforms previous parallel algorithms in number
  of parallel rounds, iterations, and solution quality.
