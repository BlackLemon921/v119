abstract: 'To scale up data analysis, distributed and parallel computing approaches
  are increasingly needed. Here we study a fundamental problem in this area: How to
  do ridge regression in a distributed computing environment? We study one-shot methods
  constructing weighted combinations of ridge regression estimators computed on each
  machine. By analyzing the mean squared error in a high dimensional model where each
  predictor has a small effect, we discover several new phenomena including that the
  efficiency depends strongly on the signal strength, but does not degrade with many
  workers, the risk decouples over machines, and the unexpected consequence that the
  optimal weights do not sum to unity. We also propose a new optimally weighted one-shot
  ridge regression algorithm. Our results are supported by simulations and real data
  analysis.'
