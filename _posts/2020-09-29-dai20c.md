abstract: In narrow asymptotic settings Gaussian VAE models of continuous data have
  been shown to possess global optima aligned with ground-truth distributions. Even
  so, it is well known that poor solutions whereby the latent posterior collapses
  to an uninformative prior are sometimes obtained in practice. However, contrary
  to conventional wisdom that largely assigns blame for this phenomena on the undue
  influence of KL-divergence regularization, we will argue that posterior collapse
  is, at least in part, a direct consequence of bad local minima inherent to the loss
  surface of deep autoencoder networks. In particular, we prove that even small nonlinear
  perturbations of affine VAE decoder models can produce such minima, and in deeper
  models, analogous minima can force the VAE to behave like an aggressive truncation
  operator, provably discarding information along all latent dimensions in certain
  circumstances. Regardless, the underlying message here is not meant to undercut
  valuable existing explanations of posterior collapse, but rather, to refine the
  discussion and elucidate alternative risk factors that may have been previously
  underappreciated.
