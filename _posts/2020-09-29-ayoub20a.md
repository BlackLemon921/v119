abstract: 'This paper studies model-based reinforcement learning (RL) for regret minimization.
  We focus on finite-horizon episodic RL where the transition model $P$ belongs to
  a known family of models $\mathcal{P}$, a special case of which is when models in
  $\mathcal{P}$ take the form of linear mixtures: $P_{\theta} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} \theta_{i}P_{i}$.
  We propose a model based RL algorithm that is based on the optimism principle: In
  each episode, the set of models that are ‘consistent’ with the data collected is
  constructed. The criterion of consistency is based on the total squared error that
  the model incurs on the task of predicting \emph{state values} as determined by
  the last value estimate along the transitions. The next value function is then chosen
  by solving the optimistic planning problem with the constructed set of models. We
  derive a bound on the regret, which, in the special case of linear mixtures, takes
  the form $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H$, $T$ and $d$ are the horizon,
  the total number of steps and the dimension of $\theta$, respectively. In particular,
  this regret bound is independent of the total number of states or actions, and is
  close to a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{HdT})$. For a general model family $\mathcal{P}$,
  the regret bound is derived based on the Eluder dimension.'
