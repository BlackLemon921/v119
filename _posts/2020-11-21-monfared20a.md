abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNN) as used in machine learning are commonly
  formulated in discrete time, i.e. as recursive maps. This brings a lot of advantages
  for training models on data, e.g. for the purpose of time series prediction or dynamical
  systems identification, as powerful and efficient inference algorithms exist for
  discrete time systems and numerical integration of differential equations is not
  necessary. On the other hand, mathematical analysis of dynamical systems inferred
  from data is often more convenient and enables additional insights if these are
  formulated in continuous time, i.e. as systems of ordinary or partial differential
  equations (ODE/ PDE). Here we show how to perform such a translation from discrete
  to continuous time for a particular class of ReLU-based RNN. We prove three theorems
  on the mathematical equivalence between the discrete and continuous time formulations
  under a variety of conditions, and illustrate how to use our mathematical results
  on different machine learning and nonlinear dynamical systems examples.
