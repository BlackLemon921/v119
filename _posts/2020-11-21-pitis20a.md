abstract: What goals should a multi-goal reinforcement learning agent pursue during
  training in long-horizon tasks? When the desired (test time) goal distribution is
  too distant to offer a useful learning signal, we argue that the agent should not
  pursue unobtainable goals. Instead, it should set its own intrinsic goals that maximize
  the entropy of the historical achieved goal distribution. We propose to optimize
  this objective by having the agent pursue past achieved goals in sparsely explored
  areas of the goal space, which focuses exploration on the frontier of the achievable
  goal set. We show that our strategy achieves an order of magnitude better sample
  efficiency than the prior state of the art on long-horizon multi-goal tasks including
  maze navigation and block stacking.
