abstract: Motivated by the repeated sale of online ads via auctions, optimal pricing
  in repeated auctions has attracted a large body of research. While dynamic mechanisms
  offer powerful techniques to improve on both revenue and efficiency by optimizing
  auctions across different items, their reliance on exact distributional information
  of buyersâ€™ valuations (present and future) limits their use in practice. In this
  paper, we propose robust dynamic mechanism design. We develop a new framework to
  design dynamic mechanisms that are robust to both estimation errors in value distributions
  and strategic behavior. We apply the framework in learning environments, leading
  to the first policy that achieves provably low regret against the optimal dynamic
  mechanism in contextual auctions, where the dynamic benchmark has full and accurate
  distributional information.
