abstract: Random Features (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations
  of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection
  between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF
  model with $P$ features, $N$ data points, and a ridge $\lambda$, we show that the
  average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an \emph{effective
  ridge} $\tilde{\lambda}$. We show that $\tilde{\lambda} > \lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda}
  \searrow \lambda$ monotonically as $P$ grows, thus revealing the \emph{implicit
  regularization effect} of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test
  error) of the $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor with the average risk of the $\lambda$-RF
  predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally,
  we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average
  $\lambda$-RF predictor and $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor.
