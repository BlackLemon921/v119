abstract: Individuals, or organizations, cooperate with or compete against one another
  in a wide range of practical situations. Such strategic interactions are often modeled
  as games played on networks, where an individualâ€™s payoff depends not only on her
  action but also on that of her neighbors. The current literature has largely focused
  on analyzing the characteristics of network games in the scenario where the structure
  of the network, which is represented by a graph, is known beforehand. It is often
  the case, however, that the actions of the players are readily observable while
  the underlying interaction network remains hidden. In this paper, we propose two
  novel frameworks for learning, from the observations on individual actions, network
  games with linear-quadratic payoffs, and in particular, the structure of the interaction
  network. Our frameworks are based on the Nash equilibrium of such games and involve
  solving a joint optimization problem for the graph structure and the individual
  marginal benefits. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed frameworks, which have theoretical as well as practical implications
  for understanding strategic interactions in a network environment.
