abstract: 'Bias in machine learning has manifested injustice in several areas, such
  as medicine, hiring, and criminal justice. In response, computer scientists have
  developed myriad definitions of fairness to correct this bias in fielded algorithms.
  While some definitions are based on established legal and ethical norms, others
  are largely mathematical. It is unclear whether the general public agrees with these
  fairness definitions, and perhaps more importantly, whether they understand these
  definitions. We take initial steps toward bridging this gap between ML researchers
  and the public, by addressing the question: does a lay audience understand a basic
  definition of ML fairness? We develop a metric to measure comprehension of three
  such definitionsâ€“demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. We evaluate
  this metric using an online survey, and investigate the relationship between comprehension
  and sentiment, demographics, and the definition itself.'
