abstract: 'The expressivity of neural networks as a function of their depth, width
  and type of activation units has been an important question in deep learning theory.
  Recently, depth separation results for ReLU networks were obtained via a new connection
  with dynamical systems, using a generalized notion of fixed points of a continuous
  map $f$, called periodic points. In this work, we strengthen the connection with
  dynamical systems and we improve the existing width lower bounds along several aspects.
  Our first main result is period-specific width lower bounds that hold under the
  stronger notion of $L^1$-approximation error, instead of the weaker classification
  error. Our second contribution is that we provide sharper width lower bounds, still
  yielding meaningful exponential depth-width separations, in regimes where previous
  results wouldnâ€™t apply. A byproduct of our results is that there exists a universal
  constant characterizing the depth-width trade-offs, as long as $f$ has odd periods.
  Technically, our results follow by unveiling a tighter connection between the following
  three quantities of a given function: its period, its Lipschitz constant and the
  growth rate of the number of oscillations arising under compositions of the function
  $f$ with itself.'
