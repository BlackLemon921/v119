abstract: Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) formulates meta-learning as a bilevel
  optimization problem, where the inner level solves each subtask based on a shared
  prior, while the outer level searches for the optimal shared prior by optimizing
  its aggregated performance over all the subtasks. Despite its empirical success,
  MAML remains less understood in theory, especially in terms of its global optimality,
  due to the nonconvexity of the meta-objective (the outer-level objective). To bridge
  such a gap between theory and practice, we characterize the optimality gap of the
  stationary points attained by MAML for both reinforcement learning and supervised
  learning, where the inner-level and outer-level problems are solved via first-order
  optimization methods. In particular, our characterization connects the optimality
  gap of such stationary points with (i) the functional geometry of inner-level objectives
  and (ii) the representation power of function approximators, including linear models
  and neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the
  global optimality of MAML with nonconvex meta-objectives for the first time.
