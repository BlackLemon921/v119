abstract: 'Fueled by massive data, important decision making is being automated with
  the help of algorithms, therefore, fairness in algorithms has become an especially
  important research topic. In this work, we design new streaming and distributed
  algorithms for the fair k-center problem that models fair data summarization. The
  streaming and distributed models of computation have an attractive feature of being
  able to handle massive data sets that do not fit into main memory. Our main contributions
  are: (a) the first distributed algorithm; which has provably constant approximation
  ratio and is extremely parallelizable, and (b) a two-pass streaming algorithm with
  a provable approximation guarantee matching the best known algorithm (which is not
  a streaming algorithm). Our algorithms have the advantages of being easy to implement
  in practice, being fast with linear running times, having very small working memory
  and communication, and outperforming existing algorithms on several real and synthetic
  data sets. To complement our distributed algorithm, we also give a hardness result
  for natural distributed algorithms, which holds for even the special case of k-center.'
