abstract: 'While sorting is an important procedure in computer science, the argsort
  operator - which takes as input a vector and returns its sorting permutation - has
  a discrete image and thus zero gradients almost everywhere. This prohibits end-to-end,
  gradient-based learning of models that rely on the argsort operator. A natural way
  to overcome this problem is to replace the argsort operator with a continuous relaxation.
  Recent work has shown a number of ways to do this, but the relaxations proposed
  so far are computationally complex. In this work we propose a simple continuous
  relaxation for the argsort operator which has the following qualities: it can be
  implemented in three lines of code, achieves state-of-the-art performance, is easy
  to reason about mathematically - substantially simplifying proofs - and is faster
  than competing approaches. We open source the code to reproduce all of the experiments
  and results.'
