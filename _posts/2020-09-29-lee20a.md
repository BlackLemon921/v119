abstract: Causal effect identifiability is concerned with establishing the effect
  of intervening on a set of variables on another set of variables from observational
  or interventional distributions under causal assumptions that are usually encoded
  in the form of a causal graph. Most of the results of this literature implicitly
  assume that every variable modeled in the graph is measured in the available distributions.
  In practice, however, the data collections of the different studies considered do
  not measure the same variables, consistently. In this paper, we study the causal
  effect identifiability problem when the available distributions encompass different
  sets of variables, which we refer to as identification under partial-observability.
  We study a number of properties of the factors that comprise a causal effect under
  various levels of abstraction, and then characterize the relationship between them
  with respect to their status relative to the identification of a targeted intervention.
  We establish a sufficient graphical criterion for determining whether the effects
  are identifiable from partially-observed distributions. Finally, building on these
  graphical properties, we develop an algorithm that returns a formula for a causal
  effect in terms of the available distributions.
