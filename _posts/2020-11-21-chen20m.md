abstract: Efficient construction of checkpoints/snapshots is a critical tool for training
  and diagnosing deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a lossy compression
  scheme for checkpoint constructions (called LC-Checkpoint). LC-Checkpoint simultaneously
  maximizes the compression rate and optimizes the recovery speed, under the assumption
  that SGD is used to train the model. LC-Checkpoint uses quantization and priority
  promotion to store the most crucial information for SGD to recover, and then uses
  a Huffman coding to leverage the non-uniform distribution of the gradient scales.
  Our extensive experiments show that LC-Checkpoint achieves a compression rate up
  to 28{\texttimes} and recovery speedup up to 5.77{\texttimes} over a state-of-the-art
  algorithm (SCAR).
