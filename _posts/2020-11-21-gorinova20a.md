abstract: 'Probabilistic programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in statistics,
  applied science, and machine learning: by decoupling modelling from inference, it
  promises to allow modellers to directly reason about the processes generating data.
  However, the performance of inference algorithms can be dramatically affected by
  the parameterisation used to express a model, requiring users to transform their
  programs in non-intuitive ways. We argue for automating these transformations, and
  demonstrate that mechanisms available in recent modelling frameworks can implement
  non-centring and related reparameterisations. This enables new inference algorithms,
  and we propose two: a simple approach using interleaved sampling and a novel variational
  formulation that searches over a continuous space of parameterisations. We show
  that these approaches enable robust inference across a range of models, and can
  yield more efficient samplers than the best fixed parameterisation.'
