abstract: In this paper, we provide an explicit theoretical connection between Sparse
  subspace clustering (SSC) and spectral clustering (SC) from the perspective of learning
  a data similarity matrix. We show that spectral clustering with Gaussian kernel
  can be viewed as sparse subspace clustering with entropy-norm (SSC+E). Compared
  to SSC, SSC+E can obtain an analytical, symmetrical, nonnegative and nonlinearly-representational
  similarity matrix. Besides, SSC+E makes use of Gaussian kernel to compute the sparse
  similarity matrix of objects, which can avoid the complex computation of the sparse
  optimization program of SSC. Finally, we provide the experimental analysis to compare
  the efficiency and effectiveness of sparse subspace clustering and spectral clustering
  on ten benchmark data sets. The theoretical and experimental analysis can well help
  users for the selection of high-dimensional data clustering algorithms.
