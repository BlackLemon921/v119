abstract: Machine learning applications often require calibrated predictions, e.g.
  a 90% credible interval should contain the true outcome 90% of the times. However,
  typical definitions of calibration only require this to hold on average, and offer
  no guarantees on predictions made on individual samples. Thus, predictions can be
  systematically over or under confident on certain subgroups, leading to issues of
  fairness and potential vulnerabilities. We show that calibration for individual
  samples is possible in the regression setup if and only if the predictions are randomized,
  i.e. outputting randomized credible intervals. Randomization removes systematic
  bias by trading off bias with variance. We design a training objective to enforce
  individual calibration and use it to train randomized regression functions. The
  resulting models are more calibrated for arbitrarily chosen subgroups of the data,
  and can achieve higher utility in decision making against adversaries that exploit
  miscalibrated predictions.
