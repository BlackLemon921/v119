abstract: 'Game-theoretic formulations of feature importance have become popular as
  a way to "explain" machine learning models. These methods define a cooperative game
  between the features of a model and distribute influence among these input elements
  using some form of the gameâ€™s unique Shapley values. Justification for these methods
  rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability
  to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise
  when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate
  these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning.
  We also draw on additional literature to argue that Shapley values do not provide
  explanations which suit human-centric goals of explainability.'
