abstract: Modern generative models are usually designed to match target distributions
  directly in the data space, where the intrinsic dimension of data can be much lower
  than the ambient dimension. We argue that this discrepancy may contribute to the
  difficulties in training generative models. We therefore propose to map both the
  generated and target distributions to the latent space using the encoder of a standard
  autoencoder, and train the generator (or decoder) to match the target distribution
  in the latent space. Specifically, we enforce the consistency in both the data space
  and the latent space with theoretically justified data and latent reconstruction
  losses. The resulting generative model, which we call a perceptual generative autoencoder
  (PGA), is then trained with a maximum likelihood or variational autoencoder (VAE)
  objective. With maximum likelihood, PGAs generalize the idea of reversible generative
  models to unrestricted neural network architectures and arbitrary number of latent
  dimensions. When combined with VAEs, PGAs substantially improve over the baseline
  VAEs in terms of sample quality. Compared to other autoencoder-based generative
  models using simple priors, PGAs achieve state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR-10
  and CelebA.
