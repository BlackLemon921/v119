abstract: We propose a novel interactive learning framework which we refer to as Interactive
  Attention Learning (IAL), in which the human supervisors interactively manipulate
  the allocated attentions, to correct the modelâ€™s behaviour by updating the attention-generating
  network. However, such a model is prone to overfitting due to scarcity of human
  annotations, and requires costly retraining. Moreover, it is almost infeasible for
  the human annotators to examine attentions on tons of instances and features. We
  tackle these challenges by proposing a sample-efficient attention mechanism and
  a cost-effective reranking algorithm for instances and features. First, we propose
  Neural Attention Processes (NAP), which is an attention generator that can update
  its behaviour by incorporating new attention-level supervisions without any retraining.
  Secondly, we propose an algorithm which prioritizes the instances and the features
  by their negative impacts, such that the model can yield large improvements with
  minimal human feedback. We validate IAL on various time-series datasets from multiple
  domains (healthcare, real-estate, and computer vision) on which it significantly
  outperforms baselines with conventional attention mechanisms, or without cost-effective
  reranking, with substantially less retraining and human-model interaction cost.
