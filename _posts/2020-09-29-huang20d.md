abstract: Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies
  tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single global
  policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies – ones
  in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express
  this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed
  as Shared Modular Policies (SMP), that correspond to each of the agent’s actuators.
  Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and
  receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed
  between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a
  single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several
  planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds,
  bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training – a process that would
  normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology.
  We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies
  as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized
  modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective. Videos and code at https://huangwl18.github.io/modular-rl/
