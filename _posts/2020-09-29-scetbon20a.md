abstract: We present a description of the function space and the smoothness class
  associated with a convolutional network using the machinery of reproducing kernel
  Hilbert spaces. We show that the mapping associated with a convolutional network
  expands into a sum involving elementary functions akin to spherical harmonics. This
  functional decomposition can be related to the functional ANOVA decomposition in
  nonparametric statistics. Building off our functional characterization of convolutional
  networks, we obtain statistical bounds highlighting an interesting trade-off between
  the approximation error and the estimation error.
