abstract: When using large-batch training to speed up stochastic gradient descent,
  learning rates must adapt to new batch sizes in order to maximize speed-ups and
  preserve model quality. Re-tuning learning rates is resource intensive, while fixed
  scaling rules often degrade model quality. We propose AdaScale SGD, an algorithm
  that reliably adapts learning rates to large-batch training. By continually adapting
  to the gradient’s variance, AdaScale automatically achieves speed-ups for a wide
  range of batch sizes. We formally describe this quality with AdaScale’s convergence
  bound, which maintains final objective values, even as batch sizes grow large and
  the number of iterations decreases. In empirical comparisons, AdaScale trains well
  beyond the batch size limits of popular “linear learning rate scaling” rules. This
  includes large-batch training with no model degradation for machine translation,
  image classification, object detection, and speech recognition tasks. AdaScale’s
  qualitative behavior is similar to that of "warm-up" heuristics, but unlike warm-up,
  this behavior emerges naturally from a principled mechanism. The algorithm introduces
  negligible computational overhead and no new hyperparameters, making AdaScale an
  attractive choice for large-scale training in practice.
