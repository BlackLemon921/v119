abstract: In this paper, we study a family of non-convex and possibly non-smooth inf-projection
  minimization problems, where the target objective function is equal to minimization
  of a joint function over another variable. This problem include difference of convex
  (DC) functions and a family of bi-convex functions as special cases. We develop
  stochastic algorithms and establish their first-order convergence for finding a
  (nearly) stationary solution of the target non-convex function under different conditions
  of the component functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
  that comprehensively studies stochastic optimization of non-convex inf-projection
  minimization problems with provable convergence guarantee. Our algorithms enable
  efficient stochastic optimization of a family of non-decomposable DC functions and
  a family of bi-convex functions. To demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithms
  we consider an important application in variance-based regularization. Experiments
  verify the effectiveness of our inf-projection based formulation and the proposed
  stochastic algorithm in comparison with previous stochastic algorithms based on
  the min-max formulation for achieving the same effect.
