abstract: 'Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently hold state-of-the-art performance
  in likelihood-based modeling of image and audio data. Generally, neural network
  based ARMs are designed to allow fast inference, but sampling from these models
  is impractically slow. In this paper, we introduce the predictive sampling algorithm:
  a procedure that exploits the fast inference property of ARMs in order to speed
  up sampling, while keeping the model intact. We propose two variations of predictive
  sampling, namely sampling with ARM fixed-point iteration and learned forecasting
  modules. Their effectiveness is demonstrated in two settings: i) explicit likelihood
  modeling on binary MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10, and ii) discrete latent modeling in
  an autoencoder trained on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Imagenet32. Empirically, we show considerable
  improvements over baselines in number of ARM inference calls and sampling speed.'
