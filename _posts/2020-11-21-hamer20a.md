abstract: Communication cost is often a bottleneck in federated learning and other
  client-based distributed learning scenarios. To overcome this, several gradient
  compression and model compression algorithms have been proposed. In this work, we
  propose an alternative approach whereby an ensemble of pre-trained base predictors
  is trained via federated learning. This method allows for training a model which
  may otherwise surpass the communication bandwidth and storage capacity of the clients
  to be learned with on-device data through federated learning. Motivated by language
  modeling, we prove the optimality of ensemble methods for density estimation for
  standard empirical risk minimization and agnostic risk minimization. We provide
  communication-efficient ensemble algorithms for federated learning, where per-round
  communication cost is independent of the size of the ensemble. Furthermore, unlike
  works on gradient compression, our proposed approach reduces the communication cost
  of both server-to-client and client-to-server communication.
