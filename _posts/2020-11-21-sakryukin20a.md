abstract: Despite recent advancements in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning,
  Deep Q-network (DQN) models still show lackluster performance on problems with high-dimensional
  action spaces. The problem is even more pronounced for cases with high-dimensional
  continuous action spaces due to a combinatorial increase in the number of the outputs.
  Recent works approach the problem by dividing the network into multiple parallel
  or sequential (action) modules responsible for different discretized actions. However,
  there are drawbacks to both the parallel and the sequential approaches. Parallel
  module architectures lack coordination between action modules, leading to extra
  complexity in the task, while a sequential structure can result in the vanishing
  gradients problem and exploding parameter space. In this work, we show that the
  compositional structure of the action modules has a significant impact on model
  performance. We propose a novel approach to infer the network structure for DQN
  models operating with high-dimensional continuous actions. Our method is based on
  the uncertainty estimation techniques introduced in the paper. Our approach achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on MuJoCo environments with high-dimensional continuous
  action spaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improvement of the introduced approach
  on a realistic AAA sailing simulator game.
