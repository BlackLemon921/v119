abstract: We consider the problem of selecting the best estimator among a family of
  Tikhonov regularized estimators, or, alternatively, to select a linear combination
  of these regularizers that is as good as the best regularizer in the family. Our
  theory reveals that if the Tikhonov regularizers share the same penalty matrix with
  different tuning parameters, a convex procedure based on $Q$-aggregation achieves
  the mean square error of the best estimator, up to a small error term no larger
  than $C\sigma^2$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise level and $C>0$ is an absolute constant.
  Remarkably, the error term does not depend on the penalty matrix or the number of
  estimators as long as they share the same penalty matrix, i.e., it applies to any
  grid of tuning parameters, no matter how large the cardinality of the grid is. This
  reveals the surprising "cost-free" nature of optimally tuning Tikhonov regularizers,
  in striking contrast with the existing literature on aggregation of estimators where
  one typically has to pay a cost of $\sigma^2\log(M)$ where $M$ is the number of
  estimators in the family. The result holds, more generally, for any family of ordered
  linear smoothers; this encompasses Ridge regression as well as Principal Component
  Regression. The result is extended to the problem of tuning Tikhonov regularizers
  with different penalty matrices.
