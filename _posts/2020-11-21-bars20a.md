abstract: 'This work focuses on the estimation of multiple change-points in a time-varying
  Ising model that evolves piece-wise constantly. The aim is to identify both the
  moments at which significant changes occur in the Ising model, as well as the underlying
  graph structures. For this purpose, we propose to estimate the neighborhood of each
  node by maximizing a penalized version of its conditional log-likelihood. The objective
  of the penalization is twofold: it imposes sparsity in the learned graphs and, thanks
  to a fused-type penalty, it also enforces them to evolve piece-wise constantly.
  Using few assumptions, we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those
  are the first in the context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying
  Ising model. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic datasets and a real-world
  dataset demonstrate the performance of our method.'
