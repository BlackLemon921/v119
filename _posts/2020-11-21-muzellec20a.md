abstract: Missing data is a crucial issue when applying machine learning algorithms
  to real-world datasets. Starting from the simple assumption that two batches extracted
  randomly from the same dataset should share the same distribution, we leverage optimal
  transport distances to quantify that criterion and turn it into a loss function
  to impute missing data values. We propose practical methods to minimize these losses
  using end-to-end learning, that can exploit or not parametric assumptions on the
  underlying distributions of values. We evaluate our methods on datasets from the
  UCI repository, in MCAR, MAR and MNAR settings. These experiments show that OT-based
  methods match or out-perform state-of-the-art imputation methods, even for high
  percentages of missing values.
