abstract: Sensitive attributes such as race are rarely available to learners in real
  world settings as their collection is often restricted by laws and regulations.
  We give a scheme that allows individuals to release their sensitive information
  privately while still allowing any downstream entity to learn non-discriminatory
  predictors. We show how to adapt non-discriminatory learners to work with privatized
  protected attributes giving theoretical guarantees on performance. Finally, we highlight
  how the methodology could apply to learning fair predictors in settings where protected
  attributes are only available for a subset of the data.
