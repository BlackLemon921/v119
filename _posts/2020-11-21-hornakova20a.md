abstract: We present an extension to the disjoint paths problem in which additional
  lifted edges are introduced to provide path connectivity priors. We call the resulting
  optimization problem the lifted disjoint paths problem. We show that this problem
  is NP-hard by reduction from integer multicommodity flow and 3-SAT. To enable practical
  global optimization, we propose several classes of linear inequalities that produce
  a high-quality LP-relaxation. Additionally, we propose efficient cutting plane algorithms
  for separating the proposed linear inequalities. The lifted disjoint path problem
  is a natural model for multiple object tracking and allows an elegant mathematical
  formulation for long range temporal interactions. Lifted edges help to prevent id
  switches and to re-identify persons. Our lifted disjoint paths tracker achieves
  nearly optimal assignments with respect to input detections. As a consequence, it
  leads on all three main benchmarks of the MOT challenge, improving significantly
  over state-of-the-art.
