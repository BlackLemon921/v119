abstract: 'We investigate the combination of actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms
  with a uniform large-scale experience replay and propose solutions for two ensuing
  challenges: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) the stability
  of off-policy learning where agents learn from other agents behaviour. To this end
  we analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs in V-trace, a form of importance sampling
  for actor-critic methods. Based on our analysis, we then argue for mixing experience
  sampled from replay with on-policy experience, and propose a new trust region scheme
  that scales effectively to data distributions where V-trace becomes unstable. We
  provide extensive empirical validation of the proposed solutions on DMLab-30 and
  further show the benefits of this setup in two training regimes for Atari: (1) a
  single agent is trained up until 200M environment frames per game (2) a population
  of agents is trained up until 200M environment frames each and may share experience.
  We demonstrate state-of-the-art data efficiency among model-free agents in both
  regimes.'
