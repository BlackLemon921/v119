abstract: We study the question of how to aggregate controllers for dynamical systems
  in order to improve their performance. To this end, we propose a framework of boosting
  for online control. Our main result is an efficient boosting algorithm that combines
  weak controllers into a provably more accurate one. Empirical evaluation on a host
  of control settings supports our theoretical findings.
