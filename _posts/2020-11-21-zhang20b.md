abstract: Deep neural networks for natural language processing tasks are vulnerable
  to adversarial input perturbations. In this paper, we present a versatile language
  for programmatically specifying string transformations—e.g., insertions, deletions,
  substitutions, swaps, etc.—that are relevant to the task at hand. We then present
  an approach to adversarially training models that are robust to such user-defined
  string transformations. Our approach combines the advantages of search-based techniques
  for adversarial training with abstraction-based techniques. Specifically, we show
  how to decompose a set of user-defined string transformations into two component
  specifications, one that benefits from search and another from abstraction. We use
  our technique to train models on the AG and SST2 datasets and show that the resulting
  models are robust to combinations of user-defined transformations mimicking spelling
  mistakes and other meaning-preserving transformations.
