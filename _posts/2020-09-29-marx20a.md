abstract: Prediction problems often admit competing models that perform almost equally
  well. This effect challenges key assumptions in machine learning when competing
  models assign conflicting predictions. In this paper, we define predictive multiplicity
  as the ability of a prediction problem to admit competing models with conflicting
  predictions. We introduce measures to evaluate the severity of predictive multiplicity,
  and develop integer programming tools to compute these measures exactly for linear
  classification problems. We apply our tools to measure predictive multiplicity in
  recidivism prediction problems. Our results show that real-world datasets may admit
  competing models that assign wildly conflicting predictions, and motivate the need
  to report predictive multiplicity in model development.
