abstract: Performance evaluations are critical for quantifying algorithmic advances
  in reinforcement learning. Recent reproducibility analyses have shown that reported
  performance results are often inconsistent and difficult to replicate. In this work,
  we argue that the inconsistency of performance stems from the use of flawed evaluation
  metrics. Taking a step towards ensuring that reported results are consistent, we
  propose a new comprehensive evaluation methodology for reinforcement learning algorithms
  that produces reliable measurements of performance both on a single environment
  and when aggregated across environments. We demonstrate this method by evaluating
  a broad class of reinforcement learning algorithms on standard benchmark tasks.
