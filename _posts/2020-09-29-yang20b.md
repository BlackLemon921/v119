abstract: Recently there has been growing interest in modeling sets with exchangeability
  such as point clouds. A shortcoming of current approaches is that they restrict
  the cardinality of the sets considered or can only express limited forms of distribution
  over unobserved data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Energy-Based Processes
  (EBPs), which extend energy based models to exchangeable data while allowing neural
  network parameterizations of the energy function. A key advantage of these models
  is the ability to express more flexible distributions over sets without restricting
  their cardinality. We develop an efficient training procedure for EBPs that demonstrates
  state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks such as point cloud generation,
  classification, denoising, and image completion
