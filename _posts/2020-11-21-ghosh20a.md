abstract: We propose a novel stochastic network model, called Fractal Gaussian Network
  (FGN), that embodies well-defined and analytically tractable fractal structures.
  Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse applications.
  FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random geometric graphs
  (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with increasingly fractal
  behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse random geometric graphs
  that are parametrised by a fractality parameter $\nu$ which governs the strength
  of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent spatial geometry of Gaussian
  Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of fractality in its own right. We
  explore the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and the problem
  of parameter estimation based on observed network data. Finally, we explore fractality
  in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block model in the setting
  of FGNs.
