abstract: In many practical applications, heuristic or approximation algorithms are
  used to efficiently solve the task at hand. However their solutions frequently do
  not satisfy natural monotonicity properties expected to hold in the optimum. In
  this work we develop algorithms that are able to restore monotonicity in the parameters
  of interest. Specifically, given oracle access to a possibly non monotone function,
  we provide an algorithm that restores monotonicity while degrading the expected
  value of the function by at most $\epsilon$. The number of queries required is at
  most logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$ and exponential in the number of parameters. We
  also give a lower bound showing that this exponential dependence is necessary. Finally,
  we obtain improved query complexity bounds for restoring the weaker property of
  $k$-marginal monotonicity. Under this property, every $k$-dimensional projection
  of the function is required to be monotone. The query complexity we obtain only
  scales exponentially with $k$ and is polynomial in the number of parameters.
