abstract: 'Researches using margin based comparison loss demonstrate the effectiveness
  of penalizing the distance between face feature and their corresponding class centers.
  Despite their popularity and excellent performance, they do not explicitly encourage
  the generic embedding learning for an open set recognition problem. In this paper,
  we analyse margin based softmax loss in probability view. With this perspective,
  we propose two general principles: 1) monotonically decreasing and 2) margin probability
  penalty, for designing new margin loss functions. Unlike methods optimized with
  single comparison metric, we provide a new perspective to treat open set face recognition
  as a problem of information transmission. And the generalization capability for
  face embedding is gained with more clean information. An auto-encoder architecture
  called Linear-Auto-TS-Encoder(LATSE) is proposed to corroborate this finding. Extensive
  experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that LATSE help face embedding to
  gain more generalization capability and it boost the single model performance with
  open training dataset to more than 99% on MegaFace test.'
