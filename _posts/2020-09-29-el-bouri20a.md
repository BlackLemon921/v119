abstract: Accurate and reliable prediction of hospital admission location is important
  due to resource-constraints and space availability in a clinical setting, particularly
  when dealing with patients who come from the emergency department. In this work
  we propose a student-teacher network via reinforcement learning to deal with this
  specific problem. A representation of the weights of the student network is treated
  as the state and is fed as an input to the teacher network. The teacher networkâ€™s
  action is to select the most appropriate batch of data to train the student network
  on from a training set sorted according to entropy. By validating on three datasets,
  not only do we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tabular
  data and performs competitively on image recognition, but also that novel curricula
  are learned by the teacher network. We demonstrate experimentally that the teacher
  network can actively learn about the student network and guide it to achieve better
  performance than if trained alone.
