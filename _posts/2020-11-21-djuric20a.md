abstract: Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machine (AMM) is an online algorithm for learning
  Multi-hyperplane Machine (MM), a classification model which allows multiple hyperplanes
  per class. AMM is based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with training time
  comparable to linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and significantly higher accuracy.
  On the other hand, empirical results indicate there is a large accuracy gap between
  AMM and non-linear SVMs. In this paper we show that this performance gap is not
  due to limited representability of the MM model, as it can represent arbitrary concepts.
  We set to explain the connection between the AMM and Learning Vector Quantization
  (LVQ) algorithms, and introduce a novel Growing AMM (GAMM) classifier motivated
  by Growing LVQ, that imputes duplicate hyperplanes into the MM model during SGD
  training. We provide theoretical results showing that GAMM has favorable convergence
  properties, and analyze the generalization bound of the MM models. Experiments indicate
  that GAMM achieves significantly improved accuracy on non-linear problems, with
  only slightly slower training compared to AMM. On some tasks GAMM comes close to
  non-linear SVM, and outperforms other popular classifiers such as Neural Networks
  and Random Forests.
