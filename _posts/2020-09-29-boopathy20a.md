abstract: Recent works have empirically shown that there exist adversarial examples
  that can be hidden from neural network interpretability (namely, making network
  interpretation maps visually similar), or interpretability is itself susceptible
  to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we theoretically show that with a proper
  measurement of interpretation, it is actually difficult to prevent prediction-evasion
  adversarial attacks from causing interpretation discrepancy, as confirmed by experiments
  on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet. Spurred by that, we develop an interpretability-aware
  defensive scheme built only on promoting robust interpretation (without the need
  for resorting to adversarial loss minimization). We show that our defense achieves
  both robust classification and robust interpretation, outperforming state-of-the-art
  adversarial training methods against attacks of large perturbation in particular.
