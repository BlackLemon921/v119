abstract: Modern meta-learning approaches for image classification rely on increasingly
  deep networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance, making batch normalization
  an essential component of meta-learning pipelines. However, the hierarchical nature
  of the meta-learning setting presents several challenges that can render conventional
  batch normalization ineffective, giving rise to the need to rethink normalization
  in this setting. We evaluate a range of approaches to batch normalization for meta-learning
  scenarios, and develop a novel approach that we call TaskNorm. Experiments on fourteen
  datasets demonstrate that the choice of batch normalization has a dramatic effect
  on both classification accuracy and training time for both gradient based- and gradient-free
  meta-learning approaches. Importantly, TaskNorm is found to consistently improve
  performance. Finally, we provide a set of best practices for normalization that
  will allow fair comparison of meta-learning algorithms.
