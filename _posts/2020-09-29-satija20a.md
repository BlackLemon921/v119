abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found tremendous success
  in simulated domains, they often cannot directly be applied to physical systems,
  especially in cases where there are hard constraints to satisfy (e.g. on safety
  or resources). In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any behavior
  as long as it maximizes rewards, but in the real world, undesired behavior can damage
  either the system or the agent in a way that breaks the learning process itself.
  In this work, we model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained
  Markov Decision Process and provide a new on-policy formulation for solving it.
  A key contribution of our approach is to translate cumulative cost constraints into
  state-based constraints. Through this, we define a safe policy improvement method
  which maximizes returns while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every
  step. We provide theoretical guarantees under which the agent converges while ensuring
  safety over the course of training. We also highlight the computational advantages
  of this approach. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on safe navigation
  tasks and in safety-constrained versions of MuJoCo environments, with deep neural
  networks.
