abstract: In pursuit of resource-economical machine learning, attempts have been made
  to dynamically adjust computation workloads in different training stages, i.e.,
  starting with a shallow network and gradually increasing the model depth (and computation
  workloads) during training. However, there is neither guarantee nor guidance on
  designing such network grow, due to the lack of its theoretical underpinnings. In
  this work, to explore the theory behind, we conduct theoretical analyses from an
  ordinary differential equation perspective. Specifically, we illustrate the dynamics
  of network growth and propose a novel performance measure specific to the depth
  increase. Illuminated by our analyses, we move towards theoretically sound growing
  operations and schedulers, giving rise to an adaptive training algorithm for residual
  networks, LipGrow, which automatically increases network depth thus accelerates
  training. In our experiments, it achieves comparable performance while reducing
  âˆ¼ 50% of training time.
