abstract: Incorporating symbolic reasoning into machine learning algorithms is a promising
  approach to improve performance on learning tasks that require logical reasoning.
  We study the problem of generating a programmatic variant of referring expressions
  that we call referring relational programs. In particular, given a symbolic representation
  of an image and a target object in that image, the goal is to generate a relational
  program that uniquely identifies the target object in terms of its attributes and
  its relations to other objects in the image. We propose a neurosymbolic program
  synthesis algorithm that combines a policy neural network with enumerative search
  to generate such relational programs. The policy neural network employs a program
  interpreter that provides immediate feedback on the consequences of the decisions
  made by the policy, and also takes into account the uncertainty in the symbolic
  representation of the image. We evaluate our algorithm on challenging benchmarks
  based on the CLEVR dataset, and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
  several baselines.
