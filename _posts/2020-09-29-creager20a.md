abstract: In many applications areas—lending, education, and online recommenders,
  for example—fairness and equity concerns emerge when a machine learning system interacts
  with a dynamically changing environment to produce both immediate and long-term
  effects for individuals and demographic groups. We discuss causal directed acyclic
  graphs (DAGs) as a unifying framework for the recent literature on fairness in such
  dynamical systems. We show that this formulation affords several new directions
  of inquiry to the modeler, where sound causal assumptions can be expressed and manipulated.
  We emphasize the importance of computing interventional quantities in the dynamical
  fairness setting, and show how causal assumptions enable simulation (when environment
  dynamics are known) and estimation by adjustment (when dynamics are unknown) of
  intervention on short- and long-term outcomes, at both the group and individual
  levels.
