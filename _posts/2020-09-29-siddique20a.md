abstract: 'As the operations of autonomous systems generally affect simultaneously
  several users, it is crucial that their designs account for fairness considerations.
  In contrast to standard (deep) reinforcement learning (RL), we investigate the problem
  of learning a policy that treats its users equitably. In this paper, we formulate
  this novel RL problem, in which an objective function, which encodes a notion of
  fairness that we formally define, is optimized. For this problem, we provide a theoretical
  discussion where we examine the case of discounted rewards and that of average rewards.
  During this analysis, we notably derive a new result in the standard RL setting,
  which is of independent interest: it states a novel bound on the approximation error
  with respect to the optimal average reward of that of a policy optimal for the discounted
  reward. Since learning with discounted rewards is generally easier, this discussion
  further justifies finding a fair policy for the average reward by learning a fair
  policy for the discounted reward. Thus, we describe how several classic deep RL
  algorithms can be adapted to our fair optimization problem, and we validate our
  approach with extensive experiments in three different domains.'
