abstract: We present a new active learning algorithm that adaptively partitions the
  input space into a finite number of regions, and subsequently seeks a distinct predictor
  for each region, while actively requesting labels. We prove theoretical guarantees
  for both the generalization error and the label complexity of our algorithm, and
  analyze the number of regions defined by the algorithm under some mild assumptions.
  We also report the results of an extensive suite of experiments on several real-world
  datasets demonstrating substantial empirical benefits over existing single-region
  and non-adaptive region-based active learning baselines.
