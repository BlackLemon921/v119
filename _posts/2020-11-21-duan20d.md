abstract: 'We propose a method for multiple hypothesis testing with familywise error
  rate (FWER) control, called the i-FWER test. Most testing methods are predefined
  algorithms that do not allow modifications after observing the data. However, in
  practice, analysts tend to choose a promising algorithm after observing the data;
  unfortunately, this violates the validity of the conclusion. The i-FWER test allows
  much flexibility: a human (or a computer program acting on the humanâ€™s behalf) may
  adaptively guide the algorithm in a data-dependent manner. We prove that our test
  controls FWER if the analysts adhere to a particular protocol of masking and unmasking.
  We demonstrate via numerical experiments the power of our test under structured
  non-nulls, and then explore new forms of masking.'
