abstract: 'Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve the state-of-the-art results on a wide
  range of image processing tasks, however, the majority of such solutions are problem-specific,
  like most AI algorithms. The One Network to Solve Them All (OneNet) procedure has
  been suggested to resolve this issue by exploiting a DNN as the proximal operator
  in Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solvers for various imaging
  problems. In this work, we make two contributions, both facilitating end-to-end
  learning using backpropagation. First, we generalize OneNet to videos by augmenting
  its convolutional prior network with bidirectional recurrent connections; second,
  we extend the fixed fully connected linear ADMM data step with another trainable
  bidirectional convolutional recurrent network. In our computational experiments
  on the Rotated MNIST, Scanned CIFAR-10 and UCF-101 data sets, the proposed modifications
  improve performance by a large margin compared to end-to-end convolutional OneNet
  and 3D Wavelet sparsity on several video processing problems: pixelwise inpainting-denoising,
  blockwise inpainting, scattered inpainting, super resolution, compressive sensing,
  deblurring, frame interpolation, frame prediction and colorization. Our two contributions
  are complementary, and using them together yields the best results.'
