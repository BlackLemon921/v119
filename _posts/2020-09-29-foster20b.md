abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for online linear-quadratic control in a known
  system subject to adversarial disturbances. Existing regret bounds for this setting
  scale as $\sqrt{T}$ unless strong stochastic assumptions are imposed on the disturbance
  process. We give the first algorithm with logarithmic regret for arbitrary adversarial
  disturbance sequences, provided the state and control costs are given by known quadratic
  functions. Our algorithm and analysis use a characterization for the optimal offline
  control law to reduce the online control problem to (delayed) online learning with
  approximate advantage functions. Compared to previous techniques, our approach does
  not need to control movement costs for the iterates, leading to logarithmic regret.
