abstract: Linear constrained convex programming has many practical applications, including
  support vector machine and machine learning portfolio problems. We propose the randomized
  primal-dual coordinate (RPDC) method, a randomized coordinate extension of the first-order
  primal-dual method by Cohen and Zhu, 1984 and Zhao and Zhu, 2019, to solve linear
  constrained convex programming. We randomly choose a block of variables based on
  a uniform distribution, linearize, and apply a Bregman-like function (core function)
  to the selected block to obtain simple parallel primal-dual decomposition. We then
  establish almost surely convergence and expected O(1/t) convergence rate, and expected
  linear convergence under global strong metric subregularity. Finally, we discuss
  implementation details for the randomized primal-dual coordinate approach and present
  numerical experiments on support vector machine and machine learning portfolio problems
  to verify the linear convergence.
