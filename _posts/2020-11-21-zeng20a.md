abstract: 'Weighted model integration (WMI) is an appealing framework for probabilistic
  inference: it allows for expressing the complex dependencies in real-world problems,
  where variables are both continuous and discrete, via the language of Satisfiability
  Modulo Theories (SMT), as well as to compute probabilistic queries with complex
  logical and arithmetic constraints. Yet, existing WMI solvers are not ready to scale
  to these problems. They either ignore the intrinsic dependency structure of the
  problem entirely, or they are limited to overly restrictive structures. To narrow
  this gap, we derive a factorized WMI computation enabling us to devise a scalable
  WMI solver based on message passing, called MP-WMI. Namely, MP-WMI is the first
  WMI solver that can (i) perform exact inference on the full class of tree-structured
  WMI problems, and (ii) perform inter-query amortization, e.g., to compute all marginal
  densities simultaneously. Experimental results show that our solver dramatically
  outperforms the existingWMI solvers on a large set of benchmarks.'
