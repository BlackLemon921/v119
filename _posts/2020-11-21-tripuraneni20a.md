abstract: 'Standard methods in supervised learning separate training and prediction:
  the model is fit independently of any test points it may encounter. However, can
  knowledge of the next test point $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ be exploited to improve prediction
  accuracy? We address this question in the context of linear prediction, showing
  how techniques from semi-parametric inference can be used transductively to combat
  regularization bias. We first lower bound the $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$ prediction error
  of ridge regression and the Lasso, showing that they must incur significant bias
  in certain test directions. We then provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$
  prediction error of two transductive prediction rules. We conclude by showing the
  efficacy of our methods on both synthetic and real data, highlighting the improvements
  single point transductive prediction can provide in settings with distribution shift.'
