abstract: Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on
  large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks
  including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive
  text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic
  evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based
  encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective.
  In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are
  generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar
  to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization
  tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative
  bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12
  downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance
  on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6
  datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation
  and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets.
