abstract: We present the first sublinear memory sketch that can be queried to find
  the nearest neighbors in a dataset. Our online sketching algorithm compresses an
  N element dataset to a sketch of size $O(N^b \log^3 N)$ in $O(N^{(b+1)} \log^3 N)$
  time, where $b < 1$. This sketch can correctly report the nearest neighbors of any
  query that satisfies a stability condition parameterized by $b$. We achieve sublinear
  memory performance on stable queries by combining recent advances in locality sensitive
  hash (LSH)-based estimators, online kernel density estimation, and compressed sensing.
  Our theoretical results shed new light on the memory-accuracy tradeoff for nearest
  neighbor search, and our sketch, which consists entirely of short integer arrays,
  has a variety of attractive features in practice. We evaluate the memory-recall
  tradeoff of our method on a friend recommendation task in the Google plus social
  media network. We obtain orders of magnitude better compression than the random
  projection based alternative while retaining the ability to report the nearest neighbors
  of practical queries.
