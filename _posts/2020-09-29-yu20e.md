abstract: "\\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}onvolutional \\textbf{N}etwork (\\textbf{GCN})
  is widely used in graph data learning tasks such as recommendation. However, when
  facing a large graph, the graph convolution is very computationally expensive thus
  is simplified in all existing GCNs, yet is seriously impaired due to the oversimplification.
  To address this gap, we leverage the \\emph{original graph convolution} in GCN and
  propose a \\textbf{L}ow-pass \\textbf{C}ollaborative \\textbf{F}ilter (\\textbf{LCF})
  to make it applicable to the large graph. LCF is designed to remove the noise caused
  by exposure and quantization in the observed data, and it also reduces the complexity
  of graph convolution in an unscathed way. Experiments show that LCF improves the
  effectiveness and efficiency of graph convolution and our GCN outperforms existing
  GCNs significantly. Codes are available on \\url{https://github.com/Wenhui-Yu/LCFN}."
