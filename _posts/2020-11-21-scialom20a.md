abstract: 'We introduce a novel approach for sequence decoding, Discriminative Adversarial
  Search (DAS), which has the desirable properties of alleviating the effects of exposure
  bias without requiring external metrics. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks
  (GANs), wherein a discriminator is used to improve the generator, our method differs
  from GANs in that the generator parameters are not updated at training time and
  the discriminator is used to drive sequence generation at inference time. We investigate
  the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the task of Abstractive Summarization:
  the results obtained show that a naive application of DAS improves over the state-of-the-art
  methods, with further gains obtained via discriminator retraining. Moreover, we
  show how DAS can be effective for cross-domain adaptation. Finally, all results
  reported are obtained without additional rule-based filtering strategies, commonly
  used by the best performing systems available: this indicates that DAS can effectively
  be deployed without relying on post-hoc modifications of the generated outputs.'
