abstract: We present a Bayesian non-parametric way of inferring stochastic differential
  equations for both regression tasks and continuous-time dynamical modelling. The
  work has high emphasis on the stochastic part of the differential equation, also
  known as the diffusion, and modelling it by means of Wishart processes. Further,
  we present a semiparametric approach that allows the framework to scale to high
  dimensions. This successfully leads us onto how to model both latent and autoregressive
  temporal systems with conditional heteroskedastic noise. We provide experimental
  evidence that modelling diffusion often improves performance and that this randomness
  in the differential equation can be essential to avoid overfitting.
