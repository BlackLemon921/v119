abstract: Self-supervision as an emerging technique has been employed to train convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) for more transferrable, generalizable, and robust representation
  learning of images. Its introduction to graph convolutional networks (GCNs) operating
  on graph data is however rarely explored. In this study, we report the first systematic
  exploration and assessment of incorporating self-supervision into GCNs. We first
  elaborate three mechanisms to incorporate self-supervision into GCNs, analyze the
  limitations of pretraining & finetuning and self-training, and proceed to focus
  on multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose to investigate three novel self-supervised
  learning tasks for GCNs with theoretical rationales and numerical comparisons. Lastly,
  we further integrate multi-task self-supervision into graph adversarial training.
  Our results show that, with properly designed task forms and incorporation mechanisms,
  self-supervision benefits GCNs in gaining more generalizability and robustness.
