abstract: Can deep neural networks learn to solve any task, and in particular problems
  of high complexity? This question attracts a lot of interest, with recent works
  tackling computationally hard tasks such as the traveling salesman problem and satisfiability.
  In this work we offer a different perspective on this question. Given the common
  assumption that NP != coNP we prove that any polynomial-time sample generator for
  an NP-hard problem samples, in fact, from an easier sub-problem. We empirically
  explore a case study, Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation
  techniques generate biased data-sets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model
  accuracy. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches that require training
  on a dense uniform sampling from the target distribution cannot be used to solve
  computationally hard problems, the reason being the difficulty of generating sufficiently
  large and unbiased training sets.
