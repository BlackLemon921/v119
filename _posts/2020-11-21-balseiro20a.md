abstract: 'We consider online allocation problems with concave revenue functions and
  resource constraints, which are central problems in revenue management and online
  advertising. In these settings, requests arrive sequentially during a finite horizon
  and, for each request, a decision maker needs to choose an action that consumes
  a certain amount of resources and generates revenue. The revenue function and resource
  consumption of each request are drawn independently and at random from a probability
  distribution that is unknown to the decision maker. The objective is to maximize
  cumulative revenues subject to a constraint on the total consumption of resources.
  We design a general class of algorithms that achieve sub-linear expected regret
  compared to the hindsight optimal allocation. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian
  dual space: they maintain a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using
  online mirror descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover
  dual sub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting
  algorithms are simple, efficient, and shown to attain the optimal order of regret
  when the length of the horizon and the initial number of resources are scaled proportionally.
  We discuss applications to online bidding in repeated auctions with budget constraints
  and online proportional matching with high entropy.'
