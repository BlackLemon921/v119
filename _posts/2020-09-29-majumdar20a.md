abstract: Many cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning environments provide
  agents with a sparse team-based reward, as well as a dense agent-specific reward
  that incentivizes learning basic skills. Training policies solely on the team-based
  reward is often difficult due to its sparsity. Also, relying solely on the agent-specific
  reward is sub-optimal because it usually does not capture the team coordination
  objective. A common approach is to use reward shaping to construct a proxy reward
  by combining the individual rewards. However, this requires manual tuning for each
  environment. We introduce Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL),
  a split-level training platform that handles the two objectives separately through
  two optimization processes. An evolutionary algorithm maximizes the sparse team-based
  objective through neuroevolution on a population of teams. Concurrently, a gradient-based
  optimizer trains policies to only maximize the dense agent-specific rewards. The
  gradient-based policies are periodically added to the evolutionary population as
  a way of information transfer between the two optimization processes. This enables
  the evolutionary algorithm to use skills learned via the agent-specific rewards
  toward optimizing the global objective. Results demonstrate that MERL significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as MADDPG, on a number of difficult coordination
  benchmarks.
