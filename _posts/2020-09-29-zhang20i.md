abstract: Single-objective black box optimization (also known as zeroth-order optimization)
  is the process of minimizing a scalar objective $f(x)$, given evaluations at adaptively
  chosen inputs $x$. In this paper, we consider multi-objective optimization, where
  $f(x)$ outputs a vector of possibly competing objectives and the goal is to converge
  to the Pareto frontier. Quantitatively, we wish to maximize the standard \emph{hypervolume
  indicator} metric, which measures the dominated hypervolume of the entire set of
  chosen inputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel scalarization function, which
  we term the \emph{hypervolume scalarization}, and show that drawing random scalarizations
  from an appropriately chosen distribution can be used to efficiently approximate
  the \emph{hypervolume indicator} metric. We utilize this connection to show that
  Bayesian optimization with our scalarization via common acquisition functions, such
  as Thompson Sampling or Upper Confidence Bound, provably converges to the whole
  Pareto frontier by deriving tight \emph{hypervolume regret} bounds on the order
  of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, we highlight the general utility of our
  scalarization framework by showing that any provably convergent single-objective
  optimization process can be converted to a multi-objective optimization process
  with provable convergence guarantees.
