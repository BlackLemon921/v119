abstract: 'The goal of neural-symbolic computation is to integrate the connectionist
  and symbolist paradigms. Prior methods learn the neural-symbolic models using reinforcement
  learning (RL) approaches, which ignore the error propagation in the symbolic reasoning
  module and thus converge slowly with sparse rewards. In this paper, we address these
  issues and close the loop of neural-symbolic learning by (1) introducing the grammar
  model as a symbolic prior to bridge neural perception and symbolic reasoning, and
  (2) proposing a novel back-search algorithm which mimics the top-down human-like
  learning procedure to propagate the error through the symbolic reasoning module
  efficiently. We further interpret the proposed learning framework as maximum likelihood
  estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and the back-search algorithm
  as a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The experiments are conducted on two weakly-supervised
  neural-symbolic tasks: (1) handwritten formula recognition on the newly introduced
  HWF dataset; (2) visual question answering on the CLEVR dataset. The results show
  that our approach significantly outperforms the RL methods in terms of performance,
  converging speed, and data efficiency. Our code and data are released at https://liqing-ustc.github.io/NGS.'
