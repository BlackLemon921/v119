abstract: 'Experience replay is central to off-policy algorithms in deep reinforcement
  learning (RL), but there remain significant gaps in our understanding. We therefore
  present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods,
  focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning
  updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies
  upend conventional wisdom around experience replay {â€”} greater capacity is found
  to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others
  unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected
  n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit
  for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay
  ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure
  its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing
  a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.'
