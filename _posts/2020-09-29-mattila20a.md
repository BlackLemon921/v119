abstract: Can the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM) be estimated from a single
  sweep through the observations â€“ and additionally, without being trapped at a local
  optimum in the likelihood surface? That is the premise of recent method of moments
  algorithms devised for HMMs. In these, correlations between consecutive pair- or
  triplet-wise observations are empirically estimated and used to compute estimates
  of the HMM parameters. Albeit computationally very attractive, the main drawback
  is that by restricting to only low-order correlations in the data, information is
  being neglected which results in a loss of accuracy (compared to standard maximum
  likelihood schemes). In this paper, we propose extending these methods (both pair-
  and triplet-based) by also including non-consecutive correlations in a way which
  does not significantly increase the computational cost (which scales linearly with
  the number of additional lags included). We prove strong consistency of the new
  methods, and demonstrate an improved performance in numerical experiments on both
  synthetic and real-world financial time-series datasets.
