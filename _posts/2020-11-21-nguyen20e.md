abstract: We build a Bayesian contextual classification model using an optimistic
  score ratio for robust binary classification when there is limited information on
  the class-conditional, or contextual, distribution. The optimistic score searches
  for the distribution that is most plausible to explain the observed outcomes in
  the testing sample among all distributions belonging to the contextual ambiguity
  set which is prescribed using a limited structural constraint on the mean vector
  and the covariance matrix of the underlying contextual distribution. We show that
  the Bayesian classifier using the optimistic score ratio is conceptually attractive,
  delivers solid statistical guarantees and is computationally tractable. We showcase
  the power of the proposed optimistic score ratio classifier on both synthetic and
  empirical data.
