abstract: 'Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are instrumental in modelling sequential
  and time-series data. Yet, when using RNNs to inform decision-making, predictions
  by themselves are not sufficient {—} we also need estimates of predictive uncertainty.
  Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in RNNs are based predominantly
  on Bayesian methods; these are computationally prohibitive, and require major alterations
  to the RNN architecture and training. Capitalizing on ideas from classical jackknife
  resampling, we develop a frequentist alternative that: (a) does not interfere with
  model training or compromise its accuracy, (b) applies to any RNN architecture,
  and (c) provides theoretical coverage guarantees on the estimated uncertainty intervals.
  Our method derives predictive uncertainty from the variability of the (jackknife)
  sampling distribution of the RNN outputs, which is estimated by repeatedly deleting
  “blocks” of (temporally-correlated) training data, and collecting the predictions
  of the RNN re-trained on the remaining data. To avoid exhaustive re-training, we
  utilize influence functions to estimate the effect of removing training data blocks
  on the learned RNN parameters. Using data from a critical care setting, we demonstrate
  the utility of uncertainty quantification in sequential decision-making.'
