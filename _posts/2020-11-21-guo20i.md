abstract: Deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been recently shown very effectively.
  However, its performance is seriously decreased when the class distribution is mismatched,
  among which a common situation is that unlabeled data contains some classes not
  seen in the labeled data. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited. This paper
  proposes a simple and effective safe deep SSL method to alleviate the harm caused
  by it. In theory, the result learned from the new method is never worse than learning
  from merely labeled data, and it is theoretically guaranteed that its generalization
  approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln(n)/n})$, even faster than the
  convergence rate in supervised learning associated with massive parameters. In the
  experiment of benchmark data, unlike the existing deep SSL methods which are no
  longer as good as supervised learning in 40% of unseen-class unlabeled data, the
  new method can still achieve performance gain in more than 60% of unseen-class unlabeled
  data. Moreover, the proposal is suitable for many deep SSL algorithms and can be
  easily extended to handle other cases of class distribution mismatch.
