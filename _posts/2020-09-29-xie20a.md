abstract: Optimally solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes
  under either full or no information sharing received significant attention in recent
  years. However, little is known about how partial information sharing affects existing
  theory and algorithms. This paper addresses this question for a team of two agents,
  with one-sided information sharingâ€”\ie both agents have imperfect information about
  the state of the world, but only one has access to what the other sees and does.
  From the perspective of a central planner, we show that the original problem can
  be reformulated into an equivalent information-state Markov decision process and
  solved as such. Besides, we prove that the optimal value function exhibits a specific
  form of uniform continuity. We also present a heuristic search algorithm utilizing
  this property and providing the first results for this family of problems.
