abstract: We study learning algorithms that optimize revenue in repeated contextual
  posted-price auctions where a seller interacts with a single strategic buyer that
  seeks to maximize his cumulative discounted surplus. The buyerâ€™s valuation of a
  good is a fixed private function of a $d$-dimensional context (feature) vector that
  describes the good being sold. In contrast to existing studies on repeated contextual
  auctions with strategic buyer, in our work, the seller is not assumed to know the
  parametric model that underlies this valuation function. We introduce a novel non-parametric
  learning algorithm that is horizon-independent and has tight strategic regret upper
  bound of $\Theta(T^{d/(d+1)})$. We also non-trivially generalize several value-localization
  techniques of non-contextual repeated auctions to make them effective in the considered
  contextual non-parametric learning of the buyer valuation function.
