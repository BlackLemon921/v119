abstract: Lying at the core of human intelligence, relational thinking is characterized
  by initially relying on innumerable unconscious percepts pertaining to relations
  between new sensory signals and prior knowledge, consequently becoming a recognizable
  concept or object through coupling and transformation of these percepts. Such mental
  processes are difficult to model in real-world problems such as in conversational
  automatic speech recognition (ASR), as the percepts (if they are modelled as graphs
  indicating relationships among utterances) are supposed to be innumerable and not
  directly observable. In this paper, we present a Bayesian nonparametric deep learning
  method called deep graph random process (DGP) that can generate an infinite number
  of probabilistic graphs representing percepts. We further provide a closed-form
  solution for coupling and transformation of these percept graphs for acoustic modeling.
  Our approach is able to successfully infer relations among utterances without using
  any relational data during training. Experimental evaluations on ASR tasks including
  CHiME-2 and CHiME-5 demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our method.
