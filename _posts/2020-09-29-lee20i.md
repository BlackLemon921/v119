abstract: Higher-order tensors arise frequently in applications such as neuroimaging,
  recommendation system, and social network analysis. We consider the problem of low-rank
  tensor estimation from possibly incomplete, ordinal-valued observations. Two related
  problems are studied, one on tensor denoising and another on tensor completion.
  We propose a multi-linear cumulative link model, develop a rank-constrained M-estimator,
  and obtain theoretical accuracy guarantees. Our mean squared error bound enjoys
  a faster convergence rate than previous results, and we show that the proposed estimator
  is minimax optimal under the class of low-rank models. Furthermore, the procedure
  developed serves as an efficient completion method which guarantees consistent recovery
  of an order-K (d,...,d)-dimensional low-rank tensor using only O(Kd) noisy, quantized
  observations. We demonstrate the outperformance of our approach over previous methods
  on the tasks of clustering and collaborative filtering.
