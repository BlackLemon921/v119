abstract: Differentiable physics is a powerful approach to learning and control problems
  that involve physical objects and environments. While notable progress has been
  made, the capabilities of differentiable physics solvers remain limited. We develop
  a scalable framework for differentiable physics that can support a large number
  of objects and their interactions. To accommodate objects with arbitrary geometry
  and topology, we adopt meshes as our representation and leverage the sparsity of
  contacts for scalable differentiable collision handling. Collisions are resolved
  in localized regions to minimize the number of optimization variables even when
  the number of simulated objects is high. We further accelerate implicit differentiation
  of optimization with nonlinear constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the presented
  framework requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory and computation in
  comparison to recent particle-based methods. We further validate the approach on
  inverse problems and control scenarios, where it outperforms derivative-free and
  model-free baselines by at least an order of magnitude.
