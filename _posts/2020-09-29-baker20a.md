abstract: We initiate the study of coresets for clustering in graph metrics, i.e.,
  the shortest-path metric of edge-weighted graphs. Such clustering problems are essential
  to data analysis and used for example in road networks and data visualization. A
  coreset is a compact summary of the data that approximately preserves the clustering
  objective for every possible center set, and it offers significant efficiency improvements
  in terms of running time, storage, and communication, including in streaming and
  distributed settings. Our main result is a near-linear time construction of a coreset
  for k-Median in a general graph $G$, with size $O_{\epsilon, k}(\mathrm{tw}(G))$
  where $\mathrm{tw}(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$, and we complement the construction
  with a nearly-tight size lower bound. The construction is based on the framework
  of Feldman and Langberg [STOC 2011], and our main technical contribution, as required
  by this framework, is a uniform bound of $O(\mathrm{tw}(G))$ on the shattering dimension
  under any point weights. We validate our coreset on real-world road networks, and
  our scalable algorithm constructs tiny coresets with high accuracy, which translates
  to a massive speedup of existing approximation algorithms such as local search for
  graph k-Median.
