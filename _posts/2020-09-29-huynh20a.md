abstract: 'We introduce a novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent,
  long-term, large-scale memory. Distinct from strategies that connect neural networks
  to external memory banks via intricately crafted controllers and hand-designed attentional
  mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed, co-located alongside computation,
  and implicitly addressed, while being drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting
  networks with multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells
  alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent
  memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally,
  permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories, while multigrid topology
  provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently
  approximate the behavior of fully connected networks. Such networks have an implicit
  capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write
  specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these
  capabilities on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize
  and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On tasks
  decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, and
  question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent
  results.'
