abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of constrained min-max optimization
  in a black-box setting, where the desired optimizer cannot access the gradients
  of the objective function but may query its values. We present a principled optimization
  framework, integrating a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator with an alternating
  projected stochastic gradient descent-ascent method, where the former only requires
  a small number of function queries and the later needs just one-step descent/ascent
  update. We show that the proposed framework, referred to as ZO-Min-Max, has a sublinear
  convergence rate under mild conditions and scales gracefully with problem size.
  We also explore a promising connection between black-box min-max optimization and
  black-box evasion and poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning (ML). Our
  empirical evaluations on these use cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
  and its scalability to dimensions that prohibit using recent black-box solvers.
