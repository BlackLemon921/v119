abstract: There is growing interest in studying the languages that emerge when neural
  agents are jointly trained to solve tasks requiring communication through a discrete
  channel. We investigate here the information-theoretic complexity of such languages,
  focusing on the basic two-agent, one-exchange setup. We find that, under common
  training procedures, the emergent languages are subject to an entropy minimization
  pressure that has also been detected in human language, whereby the mutual information
  between the communicating agentâ€™s inputs and the messages is minimized, within the
  range afforded by the need for successful communication. That is, emergent languages
  are (nearly) as simple as the task they are developed for allow them to be. This
  pressure is amplified as we increase communication channel discreteness. Further,
  we observe that stronger discrete-channel-driven entropy minimization leads to representations
  with increased robustness to overfitting and adversarial attacks. We conclude by
  discussing the implications of our findings for the study of natural and artificial
  communication systems.
