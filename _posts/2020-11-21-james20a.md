abstract: We present a framework for autonomously learning a portable representation
  that describes a collection of low-level continuous environments. We show that these
  abstract representations can be learned in a task-independent egocentric space specific
  to the agent that, when grounded with problem-specific information, are provably
  sufficient for planning. We demonstrate transfer in two different domains, where
  an agent learns a portable, task-independent symbolic vocabulary, as well as operators
  expressed in that vocabulary, and then learns to instantiate those operators on
  a per-task basis. This reduces the number of samples required to learn a representation
  of a new task.
