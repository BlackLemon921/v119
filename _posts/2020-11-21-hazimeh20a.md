abstract: Neural networks and tree ensembles are state-of-the-art learners, each with
  its unique statistical and computational advantages. We aim to combine these advantages
  by introducing a new layer for neural networks, composed of an ensemble of differentiable
  decision trees (a.k.a. soft trees). While differentiable trees demonstrate promising
  results in the literature, they are typically slow in training and inference as
  they do not support conditional computation. We mitigate this issue by introducing
  a new sparse activation function for sample routing, and implement true conditional
  computation by developing specialized forward and backward propagation algorithms
  that exploit sparsity. Our efficient algorithms pave the way for jointly training
  over deep and wide tree ensembles using first-order methods (e.g., SGD). Experiments
  on 23 classification datasets indicate over 10x speed-ups compared to the differentiable
  trees used in the literature and over 20x reduction in the number of parameters
  compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining competitive performance. Moreover,
  experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST indicate that replacing dense layers
  in CNNs with our tree layer reduces the test loss by 7-53% and the number of parameters
  by 8x. We provide an open-source TensorFlow implementation with a Keras API.
