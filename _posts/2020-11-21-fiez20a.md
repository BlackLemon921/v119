abstract: Contemporary work on learning in continuous games has commonly overlooked
  the hierarchical decision-making structure present in machine learning problems
  formulated as games, instead treating them as simultaneous play games and adopting
  the Nash equilibrium solution concept. We deviate from this paradigm and provide
  a comprehensive study of learning in Stackelberg games. This work provides insights
  into the optimization landscape of zero-sum games by establishing connections between
  Nash and Stackelberg equilibria along with the limit points of simultaneous gradient
  descent. We derive novel gradient-based learning dynamics emulating the natural
  structure of a Stackelberg game using the implicit function theorem and provide
  convergence analysis for deterministic and stochastic updates for zero-sum and general-sum
  games. Notably, in zero-sum games using deterministic updates, we show the only
  critical points the dynamics converge to are Stackelberg equilibria and provide
  a local convergence rate. Empirically, our learning dynamics mitigate rotational
  behavior and exhibit benefits for training generative adversarial networks compared
  to simultaneous gradient descent.
