abstract: Abstract Interpretability allows the domain-expert to directly evaluate
  the modelâ€™s relevance and reliability, a practice that offers assurance and builds
  trust. In the healthcare setting, interpretable models should implicate relevant
  biological mechanisms independent of technical factors like data pre-processing.
  We define personalized interpretability as a measure of sample-specific feature
  attribution, and view it as a minimum requirement for a precision health model to
  justify its conclusions. Some health data, especially those generated by high-throughput
  sequencing experiments, have nuances that compromise precision health models and
  their interpretation. These data are compositional, meaning that each feature is
  conditionally dependent on all other features. We propose the Deep Compositional
  Data Analysis (DeepCoDA) framework to extend precision health modelling to high-dimensional
  compositional data, and to provide personalized interpretability through patient-specific
  weights. Our architecture maintains state-of-the-art performance across 25 real-world
  data sets, all while producing interpretations that are both personalized and fully
  coherent for compositional data.
