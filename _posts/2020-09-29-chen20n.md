abstract: Recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to impressive performance
  but often suffer from poor calibration. They tend to be overconfident, with the
  model confidence not always reflecting the underlying true ambiguity and hardness.
  In this paper, we propose angular visual hardness (AVH), a score given by the normalized
  angular distance between the sample feature embedding and the target classifier
  to measure sample hardness. We validate this score with an in-depth and extensive
  scientific study, and observe that CNN models with the highest accuracy also have
  the best AVH scores. This agrees with an earlier finding that state-of-art models
  improve on the classification of harder examples. We observe that the training dynamics
  of AVH is vastly different compared to the training loss. Specifically, AVH quickly
  reaches a plateau for all samples even though the training loss keeps improving.
  This suggests the need for designing better loss functions that can target harder
  examples more effectively. We also find that AVH has a statistically significant
  correlation with human visual hardness. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of AVH
  to a variety of applications such as self-training for domain adaptation and domain
  generalization.
