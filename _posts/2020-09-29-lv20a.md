abstract: Partial-label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem,
  where each training instance is equipped with a set of candidate labels among which
  only one is the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed learning
  objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in specific manners,
  making their computational complexity a bottleneck for scaling up to big data. The
  goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework of PLL with flexibility on the
  model and optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a novel estimator
  of the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and
  establish an estimation error bound. Then we propose a progressive identification
  algorithm for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator, where the update
  of the model and identification of true labels are conducted in a seamless manner.
  The resulting algorithm is model-independent and loss-independent, and compatible
  with stochastic optimization. Thorough experiments demonstrate it sets the new state
  of the art.
