abstract: 'Many real-world applications have to tackle the Positive-Unlabeled (PU)
  learning problem, i.e., learning binary classifiers from a large amount of unlabeled
  data and a few labeled positive examples. While current state-of-the-art methods
  employ importance reweighting to design various biased or unbiased risk estimators,
  they completely ignored the learning capability of the model itself, which could
  provide reliable supervision. This motivates us to propose a novel Self-PU learning
  framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and self-training. Self-PU highlights
  three “self”-oriented building blocks: a self-paced training algorithm that adaptively
  discovers and augments confident positive/negative examples as the training proceeds;
  a self-reweighted, instance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces
  teacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We demonstrate
  the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning benchmarks (MNIST
  and CIFAR10), which compare favorably against the latest competitors. Moreover,
  we study a real-world application of PU learning, i.e., classifying brain images
  of Alzheimer’s Disease. Self-PU obtains significantly improved results on the renowned
  Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database over existing methods.'
