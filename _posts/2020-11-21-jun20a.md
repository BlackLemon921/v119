abstract: We present distribution augmentation (DistAug), a simple and powerful method
  of regularizing generative models. Our approach applies augmentation functions to
  data and, importantly, conditions the generative model on the specific function
  used. Unlike typical data augmentation, DistAug allows usage of functions which
  modify the target density, enabling aggressive augmentations more commonly seen
  in supervised and self-supervised learning. We demonstrate this is a more effective
  regularizer than standard methods, and use it to train a 152M parameter autoregressive
  model on CIFAR-10 to 2.56 bits per dim (relative to the state-of-the-art 2.80).
  Samples from this model attain FID 12.75 and IS 8.40, outperforming the majority
  of GANs. We further demonstrate the technique is broadly applicable across model
  architectures and problem domains.
