abstract: The field of tropical algebra is closely linked with the domain of neural
  networks with piecewise linear activations, since their output can be described
  via tropical polynomials in the max-plus semiring. In this work, we attempt to make
  use of methods stemming from a form of approximate division of such polynomials,
  which relies on the approximation of their Newton Polytopes, in order to minimize
  networks trained for multiclass classification problems. We make theoretical contributions
  in this domain, by proposing and analyzing methods which seek to reduce the size
  of such networks. In addition, we make experimental evaluations on the MNIST and
  Fashion-MNIST datasets, with our results demonstrating a significant reduction in
  network size, while retaining adequate performance.
