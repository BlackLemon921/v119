abstract: 'Over the last decade, there has been significant progress in the field
  of machine learning for de novo drug design, particularly in generative modeling
  of novel chemical structures. However, current generative approaches exhibit a significant
  challenge: they do not ensure that the proposed molecular structures can be feasibly
  synthesized nor do they provide the synthesis routes of the proposed small molecules,
  thereby seriously limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we propose
  a novel reinforcement learning (RL) setup for de novo drug design: Policy Gradient
  for Forward Synthesis (PGFS), that addresses this challenge by embedding the concept
  of synthetic accessibility directly into the de novo drug design system. In this
  setup, the agent learns to navigate through the immense synthetically accessible
  chemical space by subjecting initial commercially available molecules to valid chemical
  reactions at every time step of the iterative virtual synthesis process. The proposed
  environment for drug discovery provides a highly challenging test-bed for RL algorithms
  owing to the large state space and high-dimensional continuous action space with
  hierarchical actions. PGFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating structures
  with high QED and clogP. Moreover, we validate PGFS in an in-silico proof-of-concept
  associated with three HIV targets. Finally, we describe how the end-to-end training
  conceptualized in this study represents an important paradigm in radically expanding
  the synthesizable chemical space and automating the drug discovery process.'
