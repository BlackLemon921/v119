abstract: When quantizing neural networks, assigning each floating-point weight to
  its nearest fixed-point value is the predominant approach. We find that, perhaps
  surprisingly, this is not the best we can do. In this paper, we propose AdaRound,
  a better weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization that adapts to
  the data and the task loss. AdaRound is fast, does not require fine-tuning of the
  network, and only uses a small amount of unlabelled data. We start by theoretically
  analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural network. By approximating
  the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the rounding task is posed as a quadratic
  unconstrained binary optimization problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local
  loss and propose to optimize this loss with a soft relaxation. AdaRound not only
  outperforms rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new
  state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks. Without
  fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4 bits while
  staying within an accuracy loss of 1%.
