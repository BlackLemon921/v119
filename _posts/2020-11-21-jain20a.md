abstract: Many applications, including natural language processing, sensor networks,
  collaborative filtering, and federated learning, call for estimating discrete distributions
  from data collected in batches, some of which may be untrustworthy, erroneous, faulty,
  or even adversarial. Previous estimators for this setting ran in exponential time,
  and for some regimes required a suboptimal number of batches. We provide the first
  polynomial-time estimator that is optimal in the number of batches and achieves
  essentially the best possible estimation accuracy.
