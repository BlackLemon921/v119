abstract: The Markov assumption (MA) is fundamental to the empirical validity of reinforcement
  learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Forward-Backward Learning procedure
  to test MA in sequential decision making. The proposed test does not assume any
  parametric form on the joint distribution of the observed data and plays an important
  role for identifying the optimal policy in high-order Markov decision processes
  (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs. Theoretically, we establish the validity of
  our test. Empirically, we apply our test to both synthetic datasets and a real data
  example from mobile health studies to illustrate its usefulness.
