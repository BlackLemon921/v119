abstract: Self-play, where the algorithm learns by playing against itself without
  requiring any direct supervision, has become the new weapon in modern Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) for achieving superhuman performance in practice. However, the majority
  of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only applies to the setting where
  the agent plays against a fixed environment; it remains largely open whether self-play
  algorithms can be provably effective, especially when it is necessary to manage
  the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. We study self-play in competitive reinforcement
  learning under the setting of Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision
  processes to the two-player case. We introduce a self-play algorithm—Value Iteration
  with Upper/Lower Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB)—and show that it achieves regret $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
  after playing $T$ steps of the game, where the regret is measured by the agent’s
  performance against a fully adversarial opponent who can exploit the agent’s strategy
  at any step. We also introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves
  a slightly worse regret of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to
  run in polynomial time even in the worst case. To the best of our knowledge, our
  work presents the first line of provably sample-efficient self-play algorithms for
  competitive reinforcement learning.
