abstract: 'Multi-step greedy policies have been extensively used in model-based reinforcement
  learning (RL), both when a model of the environment is available (e.g.,Â in the game
  of Go) and when it is learned. In this paper, we explore their benefits in model-free
  RL, when employed using multi-step dynamic programming algorithms: $\kappa$-Policy
  Iteration ($\kappa$-PI) and $\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods
  iteratively compute the next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI)
  by solving a surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount
  factor. We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI
  in which the surrogate problem can be solved by any discrete or continuous action
  RL method, such as DQN and TRPO. We identify the importance of a hyper-parameter
  that controls the extent to which the surrogate problem is solved and suggest a
  way to set this parameter. When evaluated on a range of Atari and MuJoCo benchmark
  tasks, our results indicate that for the right range of $\kappa$, our algorithms
  outperform DQN and TRPO. This shows that our multi-step greedy algorithms are general
  enough to be applied over any existing RL algorithm and can significantly improve
  its performance.'
