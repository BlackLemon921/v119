abstract: "The performance of standard learning procedures has been observed to differ
  widely across groups. \tRecent studies usually attribute this loss discrepancy to
  an information deficiency for one group (e.g., one group has less data). \tIn this
  work, we point to a more subtle source of loss discrepancyâ€”feature noise. \tOur
  main result is that even when there is no information deficiency specific to one
  group (e.g., both groups have infinite data), adding the same amount of feature
  noise to all individuals leads to loss discrepancy. \tFor linear regression, we
  thoroughly characterize the effect of feature noise on loss discrepancy in terms
  of the amount of noise, the difference between moments of the two groups, and whether
  group information is used or not. \tWe then show this loss discrepancy does not
  vanish immediately if a shift in distribution causes the groups to have similar
  moments. \tOn three real-world datasets, we show feature noise increases the loss
  discrepancy if groups have different distributions, while it does not affect the
  loss discrepancy on datasets where groups have similar distributions."
