abstract: As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in real-world
  applications, there has been a growing interest in developing post hoc explanations
  that summarize the behaviors of these black boxes. However, existing algorithms
  for generating such explanations have been shown to lack stability and robustness
  to distribution shifts. We propose a novel framework for generating robust and stable
  explanations of black box models based on adversarial training. Our framework optimizes
  a minimax objective that aims to construct the highest fidelity explanation with
  respect to the worst-case over a set of adversarial perturbations. We instantiate
  this algorithm for explanations in the form of linear models and decision sets by
  devising the required optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this
  work makes the first attempt at generating post hoc explanations that are robust
  to a general class of adversarial perturbations that are of practical interest.
  Experimental evaluation with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
  our approach substantially improves robustness of explanations without sacrificing
  their fidelity on the original data distribution.
