abstract: 'Given n values possessed by n agents, we study the problem of estimating
  the mean by truthfully eliciting agents’ answers to multiple-choice questions about
  their values. We consider two natural candidates for estimation error: mean squared
  error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). We design a randomized estimator which
  is asymptotically optimal for both measures in the worst case. In the case where
  prior distributions over the agents’ values are known, we give an optimal, polynomial-time
  algorithm for MSE, and show that the task of computing an optimal estimate for MAE
  is #P-hard. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that knowledge of prior distributions
  gives a significant edge.'
