abstract: Deep generative models rely on their inductive bias to facilitate generalization,
  especially for problems with high dimensional data, like images. However, empirical
  studies have shown that variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial
  networks (GAN) lack the generalization ability that occurs naturally in human perception.
  For example, humans can visualize a woman smiling after only seeing a smiling man.
  On the contrary, the standard conditional VAE (cVAE) is unable to generate unseen
  attribute combinations. To this end, we extend cVAE by introducing a multilinear
  latent conditioning framework that captures the multiplicative interactions between
  the attributes. We implement two variants of our model and demonstrate their efficacy
  on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA. Altogether, we design a novel conditioning framework
  that can be used with any architecture to synthesize unseen attribute combinations.
