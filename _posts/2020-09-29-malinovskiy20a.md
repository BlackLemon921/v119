abstract: 'Most algorithms for solving optimization problems or finding saddle points
  of convex-concave functions are fixed-point algorithms. In this work we consider
  the generic problem of finding a fixed point of an average of operators, or an approximation
  thereof, in a distributed setting. Our work is motivated by the needs of federated
  learning. In this context, each local operator models the computations done locally
  on a mobile device. We investigate two strategies to achieve such a consensus: one
  based on a fixed number of local steps, and the other based on randomized computations.
  In both cases, the goal is to limit communication of the locally-computed variables,
  which is often the bottleneck in distributed frameworks. We perform convergence
  analysis of both methods and conduct a number of experiments highlighting the benefits
  of our approach.'
