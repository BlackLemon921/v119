abstract: We study few-shot supervised domain adaptation (DA) for regression problems,
  where only a few labeled target domain data and many labeled source domain data
  are available. Many of the current DA methods base their transfer assumptions on
  either parametrized distribution shift or apparent distribution similarities, e.g.,
  identical conditionals or small distributional discrepancies. However, these assumptions
  may preclude the possibility of adaptation from intricately shifted and apparently
  very different distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose mechanism transfer,
  a meta-distributional scenario in which a data generating mechanism is invariant
  among domains. This transfer assumption can accommodate nonparametric shifts resulting
  in apparently different distributions while providing a solid statistical basis
  for DA. We take the structural equations in causal modeling as an example and propose
  a novel DA method, which is shown to be useful both theoretically and experimentally.
  Our method can be seen as the first attempt to fully leverage the invariance of
  structural causal models for DA.
