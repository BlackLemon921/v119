abstract: This paper investigates the impact of pre-existing offline data on online
  learning, in the context of dynamic pricing. We study a single-product dynamic pricing
  problem over a selling horizon of T periods. The demand in each period is determined
  by the price of the product according to a linear demand model with unknown parameters.
  We assume that the seller already has some pre-existing offline data before the
  start of the selling horizon. The seller wants to utilize both the pre-existing
  offline data and the sequential online data to minimize the regret of the online
  learning process. We characterize the joint effect of the size, location and dispersion
  of the offline data on the optimal regret of the online learning process. Our results
  reveal surprising transformations of the optimal regret rate with respect to the
  size of the offline data, which we refer to as phase transitions. In addition, our
  results demonstrate that the location and dispersion of the offline data also have
  an intrinsic effect on the optimal regret, and we quantify this effect via the inverse-square
  law.
