abstract: Generative flows are promising tractable models for density modeling that
  define probabilistic distributions with invertible transformations. However, tractability
  imposes architectural constraints on generative flows. In this work, we study a
  previously overlooked constraint that all the intermediate representations must
  have the same dimensionality with the data due to invertibility, limiting the width
  of the network. We propose VFlow to tackle this constraint on dimensionality. VFlow
  augments the data with extra dimensions and defines a maximum evidence lower bound
  (ELBO) objective for estimating the distribution of augmented data jointly with
  the variational data augmentation distribution. Under mild assumptions, we show
  that the maximum ELBO solution of VFlow is always better than the original maximum
  likelihood solution. For image density modeling on the CIFAR-10 dataset, VFlow achieves
  a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension.
