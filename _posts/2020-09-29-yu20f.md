abstract: We consider learning a multi-class classification model in the federated
  setting, where each user has access to the positive data associated with only a
  single class. As a result, during each federated learning round, the users need
  to locally update the classifier without having access to the features and the model
  parameters for the negative classes. Thus, naively employing conventional decentralized
  learning such as distributed SGD or Federated Averaging may lead to trivial or extremely
  poor classifiers. In particular, for embedding based classifiers, all the class
  embeddings might collapse to a single point. To address this problem, we propose
  a generic framework for training with only positive labels, namely Federated Averaging
  with Spreadout (FedAwS), where the server imposes a geometric regularizer after
  each round to encourage classes to be spreadout in the embedding space. We show,
  both theoretically and empirically, that FedAwS can almost match the performance
  of conventional learning where users have access to negative labels. We further
  extend the proposed method to settings with large output spaces.
