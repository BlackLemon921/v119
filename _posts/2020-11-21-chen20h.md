abstract: We introduce a family of multilayer graph kernels and establish new links
  between graph convolutional neural networks and kernel methods. Our approach generalizes
  convolutional kernel networks to graph-structured data, by representing graphs as
  a sequence of kernel feature maps, where each node carries information about local
  graph substructures. On the one hand, the kernel point of view offers an unsupervised,
  expressive, and easy-to-regularize data representation, which is useful when limited
  samples are available. On the other hand, our model can also be trained end-to-end
  on large-scale data, leading to new types of graph convolutional neural networks.
  We show that our method achieves competitive performance on several graph classification
  benchmarks, while offering simple model interpretation. Our code is freely available
  at https://github.com/claying/GCKN.
