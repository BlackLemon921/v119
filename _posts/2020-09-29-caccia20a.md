abstract: 'We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where
  one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset
  from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application
  of auto-encoder in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived
  from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how
  to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce
  Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability
  of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate
  compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints
  and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach
  does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using
  AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to
  significant gains on continual learning benchmarks with images, LiDAR, and reinforcement
  learning agents.'
