abstract: Marrying topic models and language models exposes language understanding
  to a broader source of document-level context beyond sentences via topics. While
  introducing topical semantics in language models, existing approaches incorporate
  latent document topic proportions and ignore topical discourse in sentences of the
  document. This work extends the line of research by additionally introducing an
  explainable topic representation in language understanding, obtained from a set
  of key terms correspondingly for each latent topic of the proportion. Moreover,
  we retain sentence-topic association along with document-topic association by modeling
  topical discourse for every sentence in the document. We present a novel neural
  composite language modeling (NCLM) framework that exploits both the latent and explainable
  topics along with topical discourse at sentence-level in a joint learning framework
  of topic and language models. Experiments over a range of tasks such as language
  modeling, word sense disambiguation, document classiÔ¨Åcation, retrieval and text
  generation demonstrate ability of the proposed model in improving language understanding.
