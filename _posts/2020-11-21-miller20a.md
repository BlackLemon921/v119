abstract: We build four new test sets for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset
  (SQuAD) and evaluate the ability of question-answering systems to generalize to
  new data. Our first test set is from the original Wikipedia domain and measures
  the extent to which existing systems overfit the original test set. Despite several
  years of heavy test set re-use, we find no evidence of adaptive overfitting. The
  remaining three test sets are constructed from New York Times articles, Reddit posts,
  and Amazon product reviews and measure robustness to natural distribution shifts.
  Across a broad range of models, we observe average performance drops of 3.8, 14.0,
  and 17.4 F1 points, respectively. In contrast, a strong human baseline matches or
  exceeds the performance of SQuAD models on the original domain and exhibits little
  to no drop in new domains. Taken together, our results confirm the surprising resilience
  of the holdout method and emphasize the need to move towards evaluation metrics
  that incorporate robustness to natural distribution shifts.
