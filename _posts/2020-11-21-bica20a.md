abstract: The estimation of treatment effects is a pervasive problem in medicine.
  Existing methods for estimating treatment effects from longitudinal observational
  data assume that there are no hidden confounders, an assumption that is not testable
  in practice and, if it does not hold, leads to biased estimates. In this paper,
  we develop the Time Series Deconfounder, a method that leverages the assignment
  of multiple treatments over time to enable the estimation of treatment effects in
  the presence of multi-cause hidden confounders. The Time Series Deconfounder uses
  a novel recurrent neural network architecture with multitask output to build a factor
  model over time and infer latent variables that render the assigned treatments conditionally
  independent; then, it performs causal inference using these latent variables that
  act as substitutes for the multi-cause unobserved confounders. We provide a theoretical
  analysis for obtaining unbiased causal effects of time-varying exposures using the
  Time Series Deconfounder. Using both simulated and real data we show the effectiveness
  of our method in deconfounding the estimation of treatment responses over time.
