abstract: Bayesian optimization has demonstrated impressive success in finding the
  optimum input x$\ast$ and output f$\ast$ = f(x$\ast$) = max f(x) of a black-box
  function f. In some applications, however, the optimum output is known in advance
  and the goal is to find the corresponding optimum input. Existing work in Bayesian
  optimization (BO) has not effectively exploited the knowledge of f$\ast$ for optimization.
  In this paper, we consider a new setting in BO in which the knowledge of the optimum
  output is available. Our goal is to exploit the knowledge about f$\ast$ to search
  for the input x$\ast$ efficiently. To achieve this goal, we first transform the
  Gaussian process surrogate using the information about the optimum output. Then,
  we propose two acquisition functions, called confidence bound minimization and expected
  regret minimization, which exploit the knowledge about the optimum output to identify
  the optimum input more efficient. We show that our approaches work intuitively and
  quantitatively better performance against standard BO methods. We demonstrate real
  applications in tuning a deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the CartPole problem
  and XGBoost on Skin Segmentation dataset in which the optimum values are publicly
  available.
