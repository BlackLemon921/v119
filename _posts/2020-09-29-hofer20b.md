abstract: We propose an approach to learning with graph-structured data in the problem
  domain of graph classification. In particular, we present a novel type of readout
  operation to aggregate node features into a graph-level representation. To this
  end, we leverage persistent homology computed via a real-valued, learnable, filter
  function. We establish the theoretical foundation for differentiating through the
  persistent homology computation. Empirically, we show that this type of readout
  operation compares favorably to previous techniques, especially when the graph connectivity
  structure is informative for the learning problem.
