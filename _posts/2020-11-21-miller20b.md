abstract: Consequential decision-making incentivizes individuals to strategically
  adapt their behavior to the specifics of the decision rule. While a long line of
  work has viewed strategic adaptation as gaming and attempted to mitigate its effects,
  recent work has instead sought to design classifiers that incentivize individuals
  to improve a desired quality. Key to both accounts is a cost function that dictates
  which adaptations are rational to undertake. In this work, we develop a causal framework
  for strategic adaptation. Our causal perspective clearly distinguishes between gaming
  and improvement and reveals an important obstacle to incentive design. We prove
  any procedure for designing classifiers that incentivize improvement must inevitably
  solve a non-trivial causal inference problem. We show a similar result holds for
  designing cost functions that satisfy the requirements of previous work. With the
  benefit of hindsight, our results show much of the prior work on strategic classification
  is causal modeling in disguise.
