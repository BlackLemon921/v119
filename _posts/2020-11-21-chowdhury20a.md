abstract: Directed graphical models (DGMs) are a class of probabilistic models that
  are widely used for predictive analysis in sensitive domains such as medical diagnostics.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm for differentially-private learning of the
  parameters of a DGM. Our solution optimizes for the utility of inference queries
  over the DGM and \emph{adds noise that is customized to the properties of the private
  input dataset and the graph structure of the DGM}. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first explicit data-dependent privacy budget allocation algorithm in
  the context of DGMs. We compare our algorithm with a standard data-independent approach
  over a diverse suite of benchmarks and demonstrate that our solution requires a
  privacy budget that is roughly $3\times$ smaller to obtain the same or higher utility.
