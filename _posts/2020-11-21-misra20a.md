abstract: We present an algorithm, HOMER, for exploration and reinforcement learning
  in rich observation environments that are summarizable by an unknown latent state
  space. The algorithm interleaves representation learning to identify a new notion
  of kinematic state abstraction with strategic exploration to reach new states using
  the learned abstraction. The algorithm provably explores the environment with sample
  complexity scaling polynomially in the number of latent states and the time horizon,
  and, crucially, with no dependence on the size of the observation space, which could
  be infinitely large. This exploration guarantee further enables sample-efficient
  global policy optimization for any reward function. On the computational side, we
  show that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently whenever certain supervised
  learning problems are tractable. Empirically, we evaluate HOMER on a challenging
  exploration problem, where we show that the algorithm is more sample efficient than
  standard reinforcement learning baselines.
