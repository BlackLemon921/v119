abstract: When tasks change over time, meta-transfer learning seeks to improve the
  efficiency of learning a new task via both meta-learning and transfer-learning.
  While the standard attention has been effective in a variety of settings, we question
  its effectiveness in improving meta-transfer learning since the tasks being learned
  are dynamic and the amount of context can be substantially smaller. In this paper,
  using a recently proposed meta-transfer learning model, Sequential Neural Processes
  (SNP), we first empirically show that it suffers from a similar underfitting problem
  observed in the functions inferred by Neural Processes. However, we further demonstrate
  that unlike the meta-learning setting, the standard attention mechanisms are not
  effective in meta-transfer setting. To resolve, we propose a new attention mechanism,
  Recurrent Memory Reconstruction (RMR), and demonstrate that providing an imaginary
  context that is recurrently updated and reconstructed with interaction is crucial
  in achieving effective attention for meta-transfer learning. Furthermore, incorporating
  RMR into SNP, we propose Attentive Sequential Neural Processes-RMR (ASNP-RMR) and
  demonstrate in various tasks that ASNP-RMR significantly outperforms the baselines.
