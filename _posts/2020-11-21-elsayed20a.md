abstract: Convolutional neural networks are among the most successful architectures
  in deep learning with this success at least partially attributable to the efficacy
  of spatial invariance as an inductive bias. Locally connected layers, which differ
  from convolutional layers only in their lack of spatial invariance, usually perform
  poorly in practice. However, these observations still leave open the possibility
  that some degree of relaxation of spatial invariance may yield a better inductive
  bias than either convolution or local connectivity. To test this hypothesis, we
  design a method to relax the spatial invariance of a network layer in a controlled
  manner; we create a \emph{low-rank} locally connected layer, where the filter bank
  applied at each position is constructed as a linear combination of basis set of
  filter banks with spatially varying combining weights. By varying the number of
  basis filter banks, we can control the degree of relaxation of spatial invariance.
  In experiments with small convolutional networks, we find that relaxing spatial
  invariance improves classification accuracy over both convolution and locally connected
  layers across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets, thus suggesting that spatial
  invariance may be an overly restrictive prior.
