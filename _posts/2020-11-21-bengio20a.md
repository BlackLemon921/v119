abstract: 'We study the link between generalization and interference in temporal-difference
  (TD) learning. Interference is defined as the inner product of two different gradients,
  representing their alignment; this quantity emerges as being of interest from a
  variety of observations about neural networks, parameter sharing and the dynamics
  of learning. We find that TD easily leads to low-interference, under-generalizing
  parameters, while the effect seems reversed in supervised learning. We hypothesize
  that the cause can be traced back to the interplay between the dynamics of interference
  and bootstrapping. This is supported empirically by several observations: the negative
  relationship between the generalization gap and interference in TD, the negative
  effect of bootstrapping on interference and the local coherence of targets, and
  the contrast between the propagation rate of information in TD(0) versus TD($\lambda$)
  and regression tasks such as Monte-Carlo policy evaluation. We hope that these new
  findings can guide the future discovery of better bootstrapping methods.'
