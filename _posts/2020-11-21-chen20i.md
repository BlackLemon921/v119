abstract: Measuring the similarity between data points often requires domain knowledge,
  which can in parts be compensated by relying on unsupervised methods such as latent-variable
  models, where similarity/distance is estimated in a more compact latent space. Prevalent
  is the use of the Euclidean metric, which has the drawback of ignoring information
  about similarity of data stored in the decoder, as captured by the framework of
  Riemannian geometry. We propose an extension to the framework of variational auto-encoders
  allows learning flat latent manifolds, where the Euclidean metric is a proxy for
  the similarity between data points. This is achieved by defining the latent space
  as a Riemannian manifold and by regularising the metric tensor to be a scaled identity
  matrix. Additionally, we replace the compact prior typically used in variational
  auto-encoders with a recently presented, more expressive hierarchical oneâ€”and formulate
  the learning problem as a constrained optimisation problem. We evaluate our method
  on a range of data-sets, including a video-tracking benchmark, where the performance
  of our unsupervised approach nears that of state-of-the-art supervised approaches,
  while retaining the computational efficiency of straight-line-based approaches.
