abstract: Most existing feature selection methods in literature are linear models,
  so that the nonlinear relations between features and response variables are not
  considered. Meanwhile, in these feature selection models, the interactions between
  features are often ignored or just discussed under prior structure information.
  To address these challenging issues, we consider the problem of sparse additive
  models for high-dimensional nonparametric regression with the allowance of the flexible
  interactions between features. A new method, called as sparse shrunk additive models
  (SSAM), is proposed to explore the structure information among features. This method
  bridges sparse kernel regression and sparse feature selection. Theoretical results
  on the convergence rate and sparsity characteristics of SSAM are established by
  the novel analysis techniques with integral operator and concentration estimate.
  In particular, our algorithm and theoretical analysis only require the component
  functions to be continuous and bounded, which are not necessary to be in reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
