abstract: It has long been argued that minibatch stochastic gradient descent can generalize
  better than large batch gradient descent in deep neural networks. However recent
  papers have questioned this claim, arguing that this effect is simply a consequence
  of suboptimal hyperparameter tuning or insufficient compute budgets when the batch
  size is large. In this paper, we perform carefully designed experiments and rigorous
  hyperparameter sweeps on a range of popular models, which verify that small or moderately
  large batch sizes can substantially outperform very large batches on the test set.
  This occurs even when both models are trained for the same number of iterations
  and large batches achieve smaller training losses. Our results confirm that the
  noise in stochastic gradients can enhance generalization. We study how the optimal
  learning rate schedule changes as the epoch budget grows, and we provide a theoretical
  account of our observations based on the stochastic differential equation perspective
  of SGD dynamics.
