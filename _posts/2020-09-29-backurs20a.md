abstract: The Optimal Transport (a.k.a. Wasserstein) distance is an increasingly popular
  similarity measure for rich data domains, such as images or text documents. This
  raises the necessity for fast nearest neighbor search algorithms according to this
  distance, which poses a substantial computational bottleneck on massive datasets.
  In this work we introduce Flowtree, a fast and accurate approximation algorithm
  for the Wasserstein-1 distance. We formally analyze its approximation factor and
  running time. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of nearest neighbor search
  algorithms in the W_1 distance on real-world dataset. Our results show that compared
  to previous state of the art, Flowtree achieves up to 7.4 times faster running time.
