abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved great success in various areas, but recent
  works have found that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which
  leads to a hot topic nowadays. Although many approaches have been proposed to enhance
  the robustness of neural networks, few of them explored robust architectures for
  neural networks. On this account, we try to address such an issue from the perspective
  of dynamic system in this work. By viewing ResNet as an explicit Euler discretization
  of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), for the first time, we find that the
  adversarial robustness of ResNet is connected to the numerical stability of the
  corresponding dynamic system, i.e., more stable numerical schemes may correspond
  to more robust deep networks. Furthermore, inspired by the implicit Euler method
  for solving numerical ODE problems, we propose Implicit Euler skip connections (IE-Skips)
  by modifying the original skip connection in ResNet or its variants. Then we theoretically
  prove its advantages under the adversarial attack and the experimental results show
  that our ResNet with IE-Skips can largely improve the robustness and the generalization
  ability under adversarial attacks when compared with the vanilla ResNet of the same
  parameter size.
