abstract: The success of GANs is usually attributed to properties of the divergence
  obtained by an optimal discriminator. In this work we show that this approach has
  a fundamental flaw:\\{If} we do not impose regularity of the discriminator, it can
  exploit visually imperceptible errors of the generator to always achieve the maximal
  generator loss. In practice, gradient penalties are used to regularize the discriminator.
  However, this needs a metric on the space of images that captures visual similarity.
  Such a metric is not known, which explains the limited success of gradient penalties
  in stabilizing GANs.\\{Instead}, we argue that the implicit competitive regularization
  (ICR) arising from the simultaneous optimization of generator and discriminator
  enables GANs performance. We show that opponent-aware modelling of generator and
  discriminator, as present in competitive gradient descent (CGD), can significantly
  strengthen ICR and thus stabilize GAN training without explicit regularization.
  In our experiments, we use an existing implementation of WGAN-GP and show that by
  training it with CGD without any explicit regularization, we can improve the inception
  score (IS) on CIFAR10, without any hyperparameter tuning.
