abstract: Learning a good representation is an essential component for deep reinforcement
  learning (RL). Representation learning is especially important in multitask and
  partially observable settings where building a representation of the unknown environment
  is crucial to solve the tasks. Here we introduce Predictions of Bootstrapped Latents
  (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for
  multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future
  observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment
  dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings
  of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive
  of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect,
  allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics.
  In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides
  the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language
  instructions, rewards and more. We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board
  improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 multitask
  setting.
