abstract: We propose to study the generalization error of a learned predictor in terms
  of that of a surrogate (potentially randomized) predictor that is coupled to $\hh$
  and designed to trade empirical risk for control of generalization error. In the
  case where the learned predictor interpolates the data, it is interesting to consider
  theoretical surrogate classifiers that are partially derandomized or rerandomized,
  e.g., fit to the training data but with modified label noise. We also show that
  replacing the learned predictor by its conditional distribution with respect to
  an arbitrary $\sigma$-field is a convenient way to derandomize. We study two examples,
  inspired by the work of Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) and Bartlett et al. (2020),
  where the learned predictor interpolates the training data with high probability,
  has small risk, and, yet, does not belong to a nonrandom class with a tight uniform
  bound on two-sided generalization error. At the same time, we bound the risk of
  the learned predictor in terms of surrogates constructed by conditioning and denoising,
  respectively, and shown to belong to nonrandom classes with uniformly small generalization
  error.
