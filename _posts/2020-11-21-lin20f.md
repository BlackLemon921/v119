abstract: The remarkable recent advances in object-centric generative world models
  raise a few questions. First, while many of the recent achievements are indispensable
  for making a general and versatile world model, it is quite unclear how these ingredients
  can be integrated into a unified framework. Second, despite using generative objectives,
  abilities for object detection and tracking are mainly investigated, leaving the
  crucial ability of temporal imagination largely under question. Third, a few key
  abilities for more faithful temporal imagination such as multimodal uncertainty
  and situation-awareness are missing. In this paper, we introduce Generative Structured
  World Models (G-SWM). The G-SWM achieves the versatile world modeling not only by
  unifying the key properties of previous models in a principled framework but also
  by achieving two crucial new abilities, multimodal uncertainty and situation-awareness.
  Our thorough investigation on the temporal generation ability in comparison to the
  previous models demonstrates that G-SWM achieves the versatility with the best or
  comparable performance for all experiment settings including a few complex settings
  that have not been tested before. https://sites.google.com/view/gswm
