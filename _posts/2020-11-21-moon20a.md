abstract: Despite the power of deep neural networks for a wide range of tasks, an
  overconfident prediction issue has limited their practical use in many safety-critical
  applications. Many recent works have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but most
  of them require either additional computational costs in training and/or inference
  phases or customized architectures to output confidence estimates separately. In
  this paper, we propose a method of training deep neural networks with a novel loss
  function, named Correctness Ranking Loss, which regularizes class probabilities
  explicitly to be better confidence estimates in terms of ordinal ranking according
  to confidence. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to the
  existing architectures without any modification. Also, it has almost the same computational
  costs for training as conventional deep classifiers and outputs reliable predictions
  by a single inference. Extensive experimental results on classification benchmark
  datasets indicate that the proposed method helps networks to produce well-ranked
  confidence estimates. We also demonstrate that it is effective for the tasks closely
  related to confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection and active learning.
