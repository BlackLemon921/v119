abstract: This paper studies how to sketch element-wise functions of low-rank matrices.
  Formally, given low-rank matrix A = [Aij] and scalar non-linear function f, we aim
  for finding an approximated low-rank representation of the (possibly high-rank)
  matrix [f(Aij)]. To this end, we propose an efficient sketching-based algorithm
  whose complexity is significantly lower than the number of entries of A, i.e., it
  runs without accessing all entries of [f(Aij)] explicitly. The main idea underlying
  our method is to combine a polynomial approximation of f with the existing tensor
  sketch scheme for approximating monomials of entries of A. To balance the errors
  of the two approximation components in an optimal manner, we propose a novel regression
  formula to find polynomial coefficients given A and f. In particular, we utilize
  a coreset-based regression with a rigorous approximation guarantee. Finally, we
  demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the proposed scheme under various
  machine learning tasks.
