abstract: In this paper, we consider matrix completion with absolute deviation loss
  and obtain an estimator of the median matrix. Despite several appealing properties
  of median, the non-smooth absolute deviation loss leads to computational challenge
  for large-scale data sets which are increasingly common among matrix completion
  problems. A simple solution to large-scale problems is parallel computing. However,
  embarrassingly parallel fashion often leads to inefficient estimators. Based on
  the idea of pseudo data, we propose a novel refinement step, which turns such inefficient
  estimators into a rate (near-)optimal matrix completion procedure. The refined estimator
  is an approximation of a regularized least median estimator, and therefore not an
  ordinary regularized empirical risk estimator. This leads to a non-standard analysis
  of asymptotic behaviors. Empirical results are also provided to confirm the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
