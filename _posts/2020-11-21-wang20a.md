abstract: This paper studies binary logistic regression for rare events data, or imbalanced
  data, where the number of events (observations in one class, often called cases)
  is significantly smaller than the number of nonevents (observations in the other
  class, often called controls). We first derive the asymptotic distribution of the
  maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the unknown parameter, which shows that the
  asymptotic variance convergences to zero in a rate of the inverse of the number
  of the events instead of the inverse of the full data sample size, indicating that
  the available information in rare events data is at the scale of the number of events
  instead of the full data sample size. Furthermore, we prove that under-sampling
  a small proportion of the nonevents, the resulting under-sampled estimator may have
  identical asymptotic distribution to the full data MLE. This demonstrates the advantage
  of under-sampling nonevents for rare events data, because this procedure may significantly
  reduce the computation and/or data collection costs. Another common practice in
  analyzing rare events data is to over-sample (replicate) the events, which has a
  higher computational cost. We show that this procedure may even result in efficiency
  loss in terms of parameter estimation.
