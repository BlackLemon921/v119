abstract: Devising indicative evaluation metrics for the image generation task remains
  an open problem. The most widely used metric for measuring the similarity between
  real and generated images has been the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Since
  it does not differentiate the fidelity and diversity aspects of the generated images,
  recent papers have introduced variants of precision and recall metrics to diagnose
  those properties separately. In this paper, we show that even the latest version
  of the precision and recall metrics are not reliable yet. For example, they fail
  to detect the match between two identical distributions, they are not robust against
  outliers, and the evaluation hyperparameters are selected arbitrarily. We propose
  density and coverage metrics that solve the above issues. We analytically and experimentally
  show that density and coverage provide more interpretable and reliable signals for
  practitioners than the existing metrics.
