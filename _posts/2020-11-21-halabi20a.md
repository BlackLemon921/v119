abstract: Submodular function minimization is well studied, and existing algorithms
  solve it exactly or up to arbitrary accuracy. However, in many applications, such
  as structured sparse learning or batch Bayesian optimization, the objective function
  is not exactly submodular, but close. In this case, no theoretical guarantees exist.
  Indeed, submodular minimization algorithms rely on intricate connections between
  submodularity and convexity. We show how these relations can be extended to obtain
  approximation guarantees for minimizing non-submodular functions, characterized
  by how close the function is to submodular. We also extend this result to noisy
  function evaluations. Our approximation results are the first for minimizing non-submodular
  functions, and are optimal, as established by our matching lower bound.
