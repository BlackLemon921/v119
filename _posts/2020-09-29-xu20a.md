abstract: The variational autoencoder (VAE) can learn the manifold of natural images
  on certain datasets, as evidenced by meaningful interpolating or extrapolating in
  the continuous latent space. However, on discrete data such as text, it is unclear
  if unsupervised learning can discover similar latent space that allows controllable
  manipulation. In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly
  decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land
  in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, where the decoding
  network fails to generalize. Both as a validation of the explanation and as a fix
  to the problem, we propose to constrain the posterior mean to a learned probability
  simplex, and performs manipulation within this simplex. Our proposed method mitigates
  the latent vacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning
  of controllable representations for text. Empirically, our method outperforms unsupervised
  baselines and strong supervised approaches on text style transfer, and is capable
  of performing more flexible fine-grained control over text generation than existing
  methods.
