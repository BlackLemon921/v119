abstract: 'We make three contributions toward better understanding policy gradient
  methods in the tabular setting. First, we show that with the true gradient, policy
  gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate, with constants
  depending on the problem and initialization. This result significantly expands the
  recent asymptotic convergence results. The analysis relies on two findings: that
  the softmax policy gradient satisfies a Ł{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum
  probability of an optimal action during optimization can be bounded in terms of
  its initial value. Second, we analyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show
  that it enjoys a significantly faster linear convergence rate $O(e^{-t})$ toward
  softmax optimal policy. This result resolves an open question in the recent literature.
  Finally, combining the above two results and additional new $\Omega(1/t)$ lower
  bound results, we explain how entropy regularization improves policy optimization,
  even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate. The separation
  of rates is further explained using the notion of non-uniform Ł{}ojasiewicz degree.
  These results provide a theoretical understanding of the impact of entropy and corroborate
  existing empirical studies.'
