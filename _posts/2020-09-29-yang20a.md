abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for quantizing continuous latent representations
  in trained models. Our approach applies to deep probabilistic models, such as variational
  autoencoders (VAEs), and enables both data and model compression. Unlike current
  end-to-end neural compression methods that cater the model to a fixed quantization
  scheme, our algorithm separates model design and training from quantization. Consequently,
  our algorithm enables “plug-and-play” compression with variable rate-distortion
  trade-off, using a single trained model. Our algorithm can be seen as a novel extension
  of arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, and uses adaptive quantization accuracy
  based on estimates of posterior uncertainty. Our experimental results demonstrate
  the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image
  compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit
  rates using only a single standard VAE. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word
  embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.
