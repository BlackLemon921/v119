abstract: "\\emph{Is there a classifier that ensures optimal robustness against all
  adversarial attacks?} This paper tackles this question by adopting a game-theoretic
  point of view. We present the adversarial attacks and defenses problem as an \\emph{infinite}
  zero-sum game where classical results (\\emph{e.g.} Nash or Sion theorems) do not
  apply. We demonstrate the non-existence of a Nash equilibrium in our game when the
  classifier and the Adversary are both deterministic, hence giving a negative answer
  to the above question in the deterministic regime. Nonetheless, the question remains
  open in the randomized regime. We tackle this problem by showing that any deterministic
  classifier can be outperformed by a randomized one. This gives arguments for using
  randomization, and leads us to a simple method for building randomized classifiers
  that are robust to state-or-the-art adversarial attacks. Empirical results validate
  our theoretical analysis, and show that our defense method considerably outperforms
  Adversarial Training against strong adaptive attacks, by achieving 0.55 accuracy
  under adaptive PGD-attack on CIFAR10, compared to 0.42 for Adversarial training."
