abstract: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in discrete-valued Markov random fields
  is a fundamental problem in machine learning that involves identifying the most
  likely configuration of random variables given a distribution. Due to the difficulty
  of this combinatorial problem, linear programming (LP) relaxations are commonly
  used to derive specialized message passing algorithms that are often interpreted
  as coordinate descent on the dual LP. To achieve more desirable computational properties,
  a number of methods regularize the LP with an entropy term, leading to a class of
  smooth message passing algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper, we
  present randomized methods for accelerating these algorithms by leveraging techniques
  that underlie classical accelerated gradient methods. The proposed algorithms incorporate
  the familiar steps of standard smooth message passing algorithms, which can be viewed
  as coordinate minimization steps. We show that these accelerated variants achieve
  faster rates for finding $\epsilon$-optimal points of the unregularized problem,
  and, when the LP is tight, we prove that the proposed algorithms recover the true
  MAP solution in fewer iterations than standard message passing algorithms.
