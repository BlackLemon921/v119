abstract: We study the problem of Robust Outlier Arm Identification (ROAI), where
  the goal is to identify arms whose expected rewards deviate substantially from the
  majority, by adaptively sampling from their reward distributions. We compute the
  outlier threshold using the median and median absolute deviation of the expected
  rewards. This is a robust choice for the threshold compared to using the mean and
  standard deviation, since it can identify outlier arms even in the presence of extreme
  outlier values. Our setting is different from existing pure exploration problems
  where the threshold is pre-specified as a given value or rank. This is useful in
  applications where the goal is to identify the set of promising items but the cardinality
  of this set is unknown, such as finding promising drugs for a new disease or identifying
  items favored by a population. We propose two $\delta$-PAC algorithms for ROAI,
  which includes the first UCB-style algorithm for outlier detection, and derive upper
  bounds on their sample complexity. We also prove a matching, up to logarithmic factors,
  worst case lower bound for the problem, indicating that our upper bounds are generally
  unimprovable. Experimental results show that our algorithms are both robust and
  about $5$x sample efficient compared to state-of-the-art.
