abstract: 'To acquire a new skill, humans learn better and faster if a tutor, based
  on their current knowledge level, informs them of how much attention they should
  pay to particular content or practice problems. Similarly, a machine learning model
  could potentially be trained better with a scorer that “adapts” to its current learning
  state and estimates the importance of each training data instance. Training such
  an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging problem; in order to precisely quantify
  the effect of a data instance at a given time during the training, it is typically
  necessary to first complete the entire training process. To efficiently optimize
  data usage, we propose a reinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data
  Selection (DDS). In DDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of
  the training data, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being
  trained. Specifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it
  should up-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we
  would finally like to perform well. Without significant computing overhead, DDS
  delivers strong and consistent improvements over several strong baselines on two
  very different tasks of machine translation and image classification.'
