abstract: 'The compression of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has lately drawn
  attention, due to the increasing demand for deploying GANs into mobile devices for
  numerous applications such as image translation, enhancement and editing. However,
  compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research
  on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing
  GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and
  losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce
  AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting
  with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end
  discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource
  constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation,
  therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e.,
  needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models.
  We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution.
  Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive
  compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and
  pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD.'
