abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Preselection Bandit problem, in which the
  learner preselects a subset of arms (choice alternatives) for a user, which then
  chooses the final arm from this subset. The learner is not aware of the user’s preferences,
  but can learn them from observed choices. In our concrete setting, we allow these
  choices to be stochastic and model the user’s actions by means of the Plackett-Luce
  model. The learner’s main task is to preselect subsets that eventually lead to highly
  preferred choices. To formalize this goal, we introduce a reasonable notion of regret
  and derive lower bounds on the expected regret. Moreover, we propose algorithms
  for which the upper bound on expected regret matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic
  term of the time horizon.
