abstract: We investigate an active \emph{pure-exploration} setting, that includes
  \emph{best-arm identification}, in the context of \emph{linear stochastic bandits}.
  While asymptotically optimal algorithms exist for standard \emph{multi-armed bandits},
  the existence of such algorithms for the best-arm identification in linear bandits
  has been elusive despite several attempts to address it. First, we provide a thorough
  comparison and new insight over different notions of optimality in the linear case,
  including G-optimality, transductive optimality from optimal experimental design
  and asymptotic optimality. Second, we design the first asymptotically optimal algorithm
  for fixed-confidence pure exploration in linear bandits. As a consequence, our algorithm
  naturally bypasses the pitfall caused by a simple but difficult instance, that most
  prior algorithms had to be engineered to deal with explicitly. Finally, we avoid
  the need to fully solve an optimal design problem by providing an approach that
  entails an efficient implementation.
