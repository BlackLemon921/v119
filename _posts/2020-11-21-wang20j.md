abstract: 'Detecting rare objects from a few examples is an emerging problem. Prior
  works show meta-learning is a promising approach. But, fine-tuning techniques have
  drawn scant attention. We find that fine-tuning only the last layer of existing
  detectors on rare classes is crucial to the few-shot object detection task. Such
  a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2Â 20 points on
  current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods.
  However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of
  existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups
  of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based
  on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS. Again, our fine-tuning approach establishes
  a new state of the art on the revised benchmarks. The code as well as the pretrained
  models are available at https://github.com/ucbdrive/few-shot-object-detection.'
