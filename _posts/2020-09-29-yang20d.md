abstract: 'Recently, deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a highly
  active research area as many real-world problems can be inherently viewed as multiagent
  systems. A particularly interesting and widely applicable class of problems is the
  partially observable cooperative multiagent setting, in which a team of agents learns
  to coordinate their behaviors conditioning on their private observations and commonly
  shared global reward signals. One natural solution is to resort to the centralized
  training and decentralized execution paradigm and during centralized training, one
  key challenge is the multiagent credit assignment: how to allocate the global rewards
  for individual agent policies for better coordination towards maximizing system-level’s
  benefits. In this paper, we propose a new method called Q-value Path Decomposition
  (QPD) to decompose the system’s global Q-values into individual agents’ Q-values.
  Unlike previous works which restrict the representation relation of the individual
  Q-values and the global one, we leverage the integrated gradient attribution technique
  into deep MARL to directly decompose global Q-values along trajectory paths to assign
  credits for agents. We evaluate QPD on the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement
  tasks and show that QPD achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both homogeneous
  and heterogeneous multiagent scenarios compared with existing cooperative MARL algorithms.'
