abstract: 'Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) enjoys several benefits, such as
  data-efficiency and planning, by learning a model of the environmentâ€™s dynamics.
  However, learning a global model that can generalize across different dynamics remains
  a challenge. To tackle this problem, we decompose the task of learning a global
  dynamics model into two stages: (a) learning a context latent vector that captures
  the local dynamics, then (b) predicting the next state conditioned on it. In order
  to encode dynamics-specific information into the context latent vector, we introduce
  a novel loss function that encourages the context latent vector to be useful for
  predicting both forward and backward dynamics. The proposed method achieves superior
  generalization ability across various simulated robotics and control tasks, compared
  to existing RL schemes.'
