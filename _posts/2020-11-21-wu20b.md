abstract: Machine learning models are not static and may need to be retrained on slightly
  changed datasets, for instance, with the addition or deletion of a set of data points.
  This has many applications, including privacy, robustness, bias reduction, and uncertainty
  quantifcation. However, it is expensive to retrain models from scratch. To address
  this problem, we propose the DeltaGrad algorithm for rapid retraining machine learning
  models based on information cached during the training phase. We provide both theoretical
  and empirical support for the effectiveness of DeltaGrad, and show that it compares
  favorably to the state of the art.
