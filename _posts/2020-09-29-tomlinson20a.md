abstract: 'The way that people make choices or exhibit preferences can be strongly
  affected by the set of available alternatives, often called the choice set. Furthermore,
  there are usually heterogeneous preferences, either at an individual level within
  small groups or within sub-populations of large groups. Given the availability of
  choice data, there are now many models that capture this behavior in order to make
  effective predictionsâ€”however, there is little work in understanding how directly
  changing the choice set can be used to influence the preferences of a collection
  of decision-makers. Here, we use discrete choice modeling to develop an optimization
  framework of such interventions for several problems of group influence, namely
  maximizing agreement or disagreement and promoting a particular choice. We show
  that these problems are NP-hard in general, but imposing restrictions reveals a
  fundamental boundary: promoting a choice can be easier than encouraging consensus
  or sowing discord. We design approximation algorithms for the hard problems and
  show that they work well on real-world choice data.'
