abstract: 'Obtaining theoretical guarantees for neural networks training appears to
  be a hard problem in a general case. Recent research has been focused on studying
  this problem in the limit of infinite width and two different theories have been
  developed: a mean-field (MF) and a constant kernel (NTK) limit theories. We propose
  a general framework that provides a link between these seemingly distinct theories.
  Our framework out of the box gives rise to a discrete-time MF limit which was not
  previously explored in the literature. We prove a convergence theorem for it, and
  show that it provides a more reasonable approximation for finite-width nets compared
  to the NTK limit if learning rates are not very small. Also, our framework suggests
  a limit model that coincides neither with the MF limit nor with the NTK one. We
  show that for networks with more than two hidden layers RMSProp training has a non-trivial
  discrete-time MF limit but GD training does not have one. Overall, our framework
  demonstrates that both MF and NTK limits have considerable limitations in approximating
  finite-sized neural nets, indicating the need for designing more accurate infinite-width
  approximations for them.'
