abstract: In complex tasks, such as those with large combinatorial action spaces,
  random exploration may be too inefficient to achieve meaningful learning progress.
  In this work, we use a curriculum of progressively growing action spaces to accelerate
  learning. We assume the environment is out of our control, but that the agent may
  set an internal curriculum by initially restricting its action space. Our approach
  uses off-policy reinforcement learning to estimate optimal value functions for multiple
  action spaces simultaneously and efficiently transfers data, value estimates, and
  state representations from restricted action spaces to the full task. We show the
  efficacy of our approach in proof-of-concept control tasks and on challenging large-scale
  StarCraft micromanagement tasks with large, multi-agent action spaces.
