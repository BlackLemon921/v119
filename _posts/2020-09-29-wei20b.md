abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) is a non-convex framework that combines ADMM or other
  proximal algorithms with advanced denoiser priors. Recently, PnP has achieved great
  empirical success, especially with the integration of deep learning-based denoisers.
  However, a key problem of PnP based approaches is that they require manual parameter
  tweaking. It is necessary to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy
  in terms of imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present
  a tuning-free PnP proximal algorithm, which can automatically determine the internal
  parameters including the penalty parameter, the denoising strength and the terminal
  time. A key part of our approach is to develop a policy network for automatic search
  of parameters, which can be effectively learned via mixed model-free and model-based
  deep reinforcement learning. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments,
  that the learned policy can customize different parameters for different states,
  and often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover,
  we discuss the practical considerations of the plugged denoisers, which together
  with our learned policy yield state-of-the-art results. This is prevalent on both
  linear and nonlinear exemplary inverse imaging problems, and in particular, we show
  promising results on Compressed Sensing MRI and phase retrieval.
