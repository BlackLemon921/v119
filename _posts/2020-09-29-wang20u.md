abstract: Cooperation is often implicitly assumed when learning from other agents.
  Cooperation implies that the agent selecting the data, and the agent learning from
  the data, have the same goal, that the learner infer the intended hypothesis. Recent
  models in human and machine learning have demonstrated the possibility of cooperation.
  We seek foundational theoretical results for cooperative inference by Bayesian agents
  through sequential data. We develop novel approaches analyzing consistency, rate
  of convergence and stability of Sequential Cooperative Bayesian Inference (SCBI).
  Our analysis of the effectiveness, sample efficiency and robustness show that cooperation
  is not only possible but theoretically well-founded. We discuss implications for
  human-human and human-machine cooperation.
