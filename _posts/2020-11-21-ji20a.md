abstract: Variance-reduced algorithms, although achieve great theoretical performance,
  can run slowly in practice due to the periodic gradient estimation with a large
  batch of data. Batch-size adaptation thus arises as a promising approach to accelerate
  such algorithms. However, existing schemes either apply prescribed batch-size adaption
  rule or exploit the information along optimization path via additional backtracking
  and condition verification steps. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, which
  eliminates backtracking line search but still exploits the information along optimization
  path by adapting the batch size via history stochastic gradients. We further theoretically
  show that such a scheme substantially reduces the overall complexity for popular
  variance-reduced algorithms SVRG and SARAH/SPIDER for both conventional nonconvex
  optimization and reinforcement learning problems. To this end, we develop a new
  convergence analysis framework to handle the dependence of the batch size on history
  stochastic gradients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed
  batch-size adaptation scheme.
