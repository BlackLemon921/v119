abstract: Normalizing flows transform a latent distribution through an invertible
  neural network for a flexible and pleasingly simple approach to generative modelling,
  while preserving an exact likelihood. We propose FlowGMM, an end-to-end approach
  to generative semi supervised learning with normalizing flows, using a latent Gaussian
  mixture model. FlowGMM is distinct in its simplicity, unified treatment of labelled
  and unlabelled data with an exact likelihood, interpretability, and broad applicability
  beyond image data. We show promising results on a wide range of applications, including
  AG-News and Yahoo Answers text data, tabular data, and semi-supervised image classification.
  We also show that FlowGMM can discover interpretable structure, provide real-time
  optimization-free feature visualizations, and specify well calibrated predictive
  distributions.
