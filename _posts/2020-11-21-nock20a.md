abstract: Supervised learning requires the specification of a loss function to minimise.
  While the theory of admissible losses from both a computational and statistical
  perspective is well-developed, these offer a panoply of different choices. In practice,
  this choice is typically made in an \emph{ad hoc} manner. In hopes of making this
  procedure more principled, the problem of \emph{learning the loss function} for
  a downstream task (e.g., classification) has garnered recent interest. However,
  works in this area have been generally empirical in nature. In this paper, we revisit
  the {\sc SLIsotron} algorithm of Kakade et al. (2011) through a novel lens, derive
  a generalisation based on Bregman divergences, and show how it provides a principled
  procedure for learning the loss. In detail, we cast {\sc SLIsotron} as learning
  a loss from a family of composite square losses. By interpreting this through the
  lens of \emph{proper losses}, we derive a generalisation of {\sc SLIsotron} based
  on Bregman divergences. The resulting {\sc BregmanTron} algorithm jointly learns
  the loss along with the classifier. It comes equipped with a simple guarantee of
  convergence for the loss it learns, and its set of possible outputs comes with a
  guarantee of agnostic approximability of Bayes rule. Experiments indicate that the
  {\sc BregmanTron} significantly outperforms the {\sc SLIsotron}, and that the loss
  it learns can be minimized by other algorithms for different tasks, thereby opening
  the interesting problem of \emph{loss transfer} between domains.
