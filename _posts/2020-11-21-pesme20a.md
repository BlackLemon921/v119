abstract: 'Constant step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent exhibits two phases: a transient
  phase during which iterates make fast progress towards the optimum, followed by
  a stationary phase during which iterates oscillate around the optimal point. In
  this paper, we show that efficiently detecting this transition and appropriately
  decreasing the step size can lead to fast convergence rates. We analyse the classical
  statistical test proposed by Pflug (1983), based on the inner product between consecutive
  stochastic gradients. Even in the simple case where the objective function is quadratic
  we show that this test cannot lead to an adequate convergence diagnostic. We then
  propose a novel and simple statistical procedure that accurately detects stationarity
  and we provide experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance on synthetic
  and real-word datasets.'
