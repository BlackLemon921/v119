abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning the weighted edges of a balanced mixture
  of two undirected graphs from epidemic cascades. While mixture models are popular
  modeling tools, algorithmic development with rigorous guarantees has lagged. Graph
  mixtures are apparently no exception: until now, very little is known about whether
  this problem is solvable. To the best of our knowledge, we establish the first necessary
  and sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable in polynomial time on
  edge-separated graphs. When the conditions are met, i.e., when the graphs are connected
  with at least three edges, we give an efficient algorithm for learning the weights
  of both graphs with optimal sample complexity (up to log factors). We give complementary
  results and provide sample-optimal (up to log factors) algorithms for mixtures of
  directed graphs of out-degree at least three, and for mixture of undirected graphs
  of unbalanced and/or unknown priors.'
