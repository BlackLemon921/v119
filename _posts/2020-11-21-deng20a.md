abstract: Robust optimization has been widely used in nowadays data science, especially
  in adversarial training. However, little research has been done to quantify how
  robust optimization changes the optimizers and the prediction losses comparing to
  standard training. In this paper, inspired by the influence function in robust statistics,
  we introduce the Adversarial Influence Function (AIF) as a tool to investigate the
  solution produced by robust optimization. The proposed AIF enjoys a closed-form
  and can be calculated efficiently. To illustrate the usage of AIF, we apply it to
  study model sensitivity â€” a quantity defined to capture the change of prediction
  losses on the natural data after implementing robust optimization. We use AIF to
  analyze how model complexity and randomized smoothing affect the model sensitivity
  with respect to specific models. We further derive AIF for kernel regressions, with
  a particular application to neural tangent kernels, and experimentally demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed AIF. Lastly, the theories of AIF will be extended
  to distributional robust optimization.
