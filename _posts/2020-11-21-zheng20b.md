abstract: 'The objective of a reinforcement learning agent is to behave so as to maximise
  the sum of a suitable scalar function of state: the reward. These rewards are typically
  given and immutable. In this paper, we instead consider the proposition that the
  reward function itself can be a good locus of learned knowledge. To investigate
  this, we propose a scalable meta-gradient framework for learning useful intrinsic
  reward functions across multiple lifetimes of experience. Through several proof-of-concept
  experiments, we show that it is feasible to learn and capture knowledge about long-term
  exploration and exploitation into a reward function. Furthermore, we show that unlike
  policy transfer methods that capture “how” the agent should behave, the learned
  reward functions can generalise to other kinds of agents and to changes in the dynamics
  of the environment by capturing “what” the agent should strive to do.'
