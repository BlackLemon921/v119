abstract: Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional
  electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology, medicine,
  nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in developing programming
  paradigms for molecular computation that are well-aligned with the underlying chemical
  hardware and do not attempt to shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover
  a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight
  ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely
  robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation
  makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect
  neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques,
  can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular
  programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and
  MNIST datasets. Toward intended applications of chemical computation, we further
  use our method to generate a chemical reaction network that can discriminate between
  different virus types based on gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for
  rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.
