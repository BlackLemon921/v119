abstract: The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets is limited
  due to heavy memory and computational requirements. A variety of methods has been
  proposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the kernel
  matrix. Previous methods, however, cannot easily deal with mixtures of non-stationary
  processes. This paper investigates an efficient GP framework, that extends structured
  kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary phase. We particularly
  treat the separation of nonstationary sources, which is a problem that commonly
  arises e.g. in spatio-temporal biomedical datasets. Our approach employs multiple
  sets of non-equidistant inducing points to account for the non-stationarity and
  retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker structure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient
  inference and kernel learning. Our approach is demonstrated on numerical examples
  and large spatio-temporal biomedical problems.
