abstract: 'Local differential privacy (LDP) is a strong notion of privacy that often
  leads to a significant drop in utility. The original definition of LDP assumes that
  all the elements in the data domain are equally sensitive. However, in many real-life
  applications, some elements are more sensitive than others. We propose a context-aware
  framework for LDP that allows the privacy level to vary across the data domain,
  enabling system designers to place privacy constraints where they matter without
  paying the cost where they do not. For binary data domains, we provide a universally
  optimal privatization scheme and highlight its connections to Warner’s randomized
  response and Mangat’s improved response. Motivated by geo-location and web search
  applications, for k-ary data domains, we consider two special cases of context-aware
  LDP: block-structured LDP and high-low LDP. We study minimax discrete distribution
  estimation under both cases and provide communication-efficient, sample-optimal
  schemes, and information-theoretic lower bounds. We show, using worst-case analyses
  and experiments on Gowalla’s 3.6 million check-ins to 43,750 locations, that context-aware
  LDP achieves a far better accuracy under the same number of samples.'
