abstract: 'We consider the problem of allocating a fixed budget of samples to a finite
  set of discrete distributions to learn them uniformly well (minimizing the maximum
  error) in terms of four common distance measures: $\ell_2^2$, $\ell_1$, $f$-divergence,
  and separation distance. To present a unified treatment of these distances, we first
  propose a general \emph{optimistic tracking algorithm} and analyze its sample allocation
  performance w.r.t.Â an oracle. We then instantiate this algorithm for the four distance
  measures and derive bounds on their regret. We also show that the allocation performance
  of the proposed algorithm cannot, in general, be improved, by deriving lower-bounds
  on the expected deviation from the oracle allocation for any adaptive scheme. We
  verify our theoretical findings through some experiments. Finally, we show that
  the techniques developed in the paper can be easily extended to learn some classes
  of continuous distributions as well as to the related setting of minimizing the
  average error (in terms of the four distances) in learning a set of distributions.'
