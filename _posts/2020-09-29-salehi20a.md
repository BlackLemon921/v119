abstract: 'Logistic models are commonly used for binary classification tasks. The
  success of such models has often been attributed to their connection to maximum-likelihood
  estimators. It has been shown that gradient descent algorithm, when applied on the
  logistic loss, converges to the max-margin classifier (a.k.a. hard-margin SVM).
  The performance of the max-margin classifier has been recently analyzed in \cite{montanari2019generalization,
  deng2019model}. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we present and study a
  more general setting, where the underlying parameters of the logistic model possess
  certain structures (sparse, block-sparse, low-rank, etc.) and introduce a more general
  framework (which is referred to as “Generalized Margin Maximizer”, GMM). While classical
  max-margin classifiers minimize the $2$-norm of the parameter vector subject to
  linearly separating the data, GMM minimizes any arbitrary convex function of the
  parameter vector. We provide a precise analysis of the performance of GMM via the
  solution of a system of nonlinear equations. We also provide a detailed study for
  three special cases: ($1$) $\ell_2$-GMM that is the max-margin classifier, ($2$)
  $\ell_1$-GMM which encourages sparsity, and ($3$) $\ell_{\infty}$-GMM which is often
  used when the parameter vector has binary entries. Our theoretical results are validated
  by extensive simulation results across a range of parameter values, problem instances,
  and model structures.'
