abstract: We propose a reward function estimation framework for inverse reinforcement
  learning with deep energy-based policies. We name our method PQR, as it sequentially
  estimates the Policy, the Q-function, and the Reward function by deep learning.
  PQR does not assume that the reward solely depends on the state, instead it allows
  for a dependency on the choice of action. Moreover, PQR allows for stochastic state
  transitions. To accomplish this, we assume the existence of one anchor action whose
  reward is known, typically the action of doing nothing, yielding no reward. We present
  both estimators and algorithms for the PQR method. When the environment transition
  is known, we prove that the PQR reward estimator uniquely recovers the true reward.
  With unknown transitions, we bound the estimation error of PQR. Finally, the performance
  of PQR is demonstrated by synthetic and real-world datasets.
