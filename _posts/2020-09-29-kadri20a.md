abstract: The trace regression model, a direct extension of the well-studied linear
  regression model, allows one to map matrices to real-valued outputs. We here introduce
  an even more general model, namely the partial-trace regression model, a family
  of linear mappings from matrix-valued inputs to matrix-valued outputs; this model
  subsumes the trace regression model and thus the linear regression model. Borrowing
  tools from quantum information theory, where partial trace operators have been extensively
  studied, we propose a framework for learning partial trace regression models from
  data by taking advantage of the so-called low-rank Kraus representation of completely
  positive maps. We show the relevance of our framework with synthetic and real-world
  experiments conducted for both i) matrix-to-matrix regression and ii) positive semidefinite
  matrix completion, two tasks which can be formulated as partial trace regression
  problems.
