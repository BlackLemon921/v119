abstract: Ordered Weighted $L_{1}$ (OWL) regularized regression is a new regression
  analysis for high-dimensional sparse learning. Proximal gradient methods are used
  as standard approaches to solve OWL regression. However, it is still a burning issue
  to solve OWL regression due to considerable computational cost and memory usage
  when the feature or sample size is large. In this paper, we propose the first safe
  screening rule for OWL regression by exploring the order of the primal solution
  with the unknown order structure via an iterative strategy, which overcomes the
  difficulties of tackling the non-separable regularizer. It effectively avoids the
  updates of the parameters whose coefficients must be zero during the learning process.
  More importantly, the proposed screening rule can be easily applied to standard
  and stochastic proximal gradient methods. Moreover, we prove that the algorithms
  with our screening rule are guaranteed to have identical results with the original
  algorithms. Experimental results on a variety of datasets show that our screening
  rule leads to a significant computational gain without any loss of accuracy, compared
  to existing competitive algorithms.
