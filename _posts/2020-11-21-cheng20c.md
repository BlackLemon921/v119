abstract: Instance- and Label-dependent label Noise (ILN) widely exists in real-world
  datasets but has been rarely studied. In this paper, we focus on Bounded Instance-
  and Label-dependent label Noise (BILN), a particular case of ILN where the label
  noise rates—the probabilities that the true labels of examples flip into the corrupted
  ones—have upper bound less than $1$. Specifically, we introduce the concept of distilled
  examples, i.e. examples whose labels are identical with the labels assigned for
  them by the Bayes optimal classifier, and prove that under certain conditions classifiers
  learnt on distilled examples will converge to the Bayes optimal classifier. Inspired
  by the idea of learning with distilled examples, we then propose a learning algorithm
  with theoretical guarantees for its robustness to BILN. At last, empirical evaluations
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets show effectiveness of our algorithm in
  learning with BILN.
