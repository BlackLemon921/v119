abstract: Deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy across a broad spectrum
  of tasks, but rigorously quantifying their predictive uncertainty remains challenging.
  Usable estimates of predictive uncertainty should (1) cover the true prediction
  targets with high probability, and (2) discriminate between high- and low confidence
  prediction instances. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification are based
  predominantly on Bayesian neural networks; these may fall short of (1) and (2) {—}
  i.e., Bayesian credible intervals do not guarantee frequentist coverage, and approximate
  posterior inference undermines discriminative accuracy. In this paper, we develop
  the discriminative jackknife (DJ), a frequentist procedure that utilizes influence
  functions of a model’s loss functional to construct a jackknife (or leave one-out)
  estimator of predictive confidence intervals. The DJ satisfies (1) and (2), is applicable
  to a wide range of deep learning models, is easy to implement, and can be applied
  in a post-hoc fashion without interfering with model training or compromising its
  accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DJ performs competitively compared to existing
  Bayesian and non-Bayesian regression baselines.
