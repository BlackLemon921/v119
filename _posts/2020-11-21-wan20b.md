abstract: To deal with complicated constraints via locally light computations in distributed
  online learning, a recent study has presented a projection-free algorithm called
  distributed online conditional gradient (D-OCG), and achieved an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret
  bound, where $T$ is the number of prediction rounds. However, in each round, the
  local learners of D-OCG need to communicate with their neighbors to share the local
  gradients, which results in a high communication complexity of $O(T)$. In this paper,
  we first propose an improved variant of D-OCG, namely D-BOCG, which enjoys an $O(T^{3/4})$
  regret bound with only $O(\sqrt{T})$ communication complexity. The key idea is to
  divide the total prediction rounds into $\sqrt{T}$ equally-sized blocks, and only
  update the local learners at the beginning of each block by performing iterative
  linear optimization steps. Furthermore, to handle the more challenging bandit setting,
  in which only the loss value is available, we incorporate the classical one-point
  gradient estimator into D-BOCG, and obtain similar theoretical guarantees.
