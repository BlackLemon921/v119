abstract: Invariance (defined in a general sense) has been one of the most effective
  priors for representation learning. Direct factorization of parametric models is
  feasible only for a small range of invariances, while regularization approaches,
  despite improved generality, lead to nonconvex optimization. In this work, we develop
  a \emph{convex} representation learning algorithm for a variety of generalized invariances
  that can be modeled as semi-norms. Novel Euclidean embeddings are introduced for
  kernel representers in a semi-inner-product space, and approximation bounds are
  established. This allows invariant representations to be learned efficiently and
  effectively as confirmed in our experiments, along with accurate predictions.
