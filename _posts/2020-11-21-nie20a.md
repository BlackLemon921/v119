abstract: 'Disentanglement learning is crucial for obtaining disentangled representations
  and controllable generation. Current disentanglement methods face several inherent
  limitations: difficulty with high-resolution images, primarily focusing on learning
  disentangled representations, and non-identifiability due to the unsupervised setting.
  To alleviate these limitations, we design new architectures and loss functions based
  on StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019), for semi-supervised high-resolution disentanglement
  learning. We create two complex high-resolution synthetic datasets for systematic
  testing. We investigate the impact of limited supervision and find that using only
  0.25%Â 2.5% of labeled data is sufficient for good disentanglement on both synthetic
  and real datasets. We propose new metrics to quantify generator controllability,
  and observe there may exist a crucial trade-off between disentangled representation
  learning and controllable generation. We also consider semantic fine-grained image
  editing to achieve better generalization to unseen images.'
