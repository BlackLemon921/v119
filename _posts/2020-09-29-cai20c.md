abstract: 'We study the distribution and uncertainty of nonconvex optimization for
  noisy tensor completion — the problem of estimating a low-rank tensor given incomplete
  and corrupted observations of its entries. Focusing on a two-stage nonconvex estimation
  algorithm proposed by (Cai et al., 2019), we characterize the distribution of this
  estimator down to fine scales. This distributional theory in turn allows one to
  construct valid and short confidence intervals for both the unseen tensor entries
  and its underlying tensor factors. The proposed inferential procedure enjoys several
  important features: (1) it is fully adaptive to noise heteroscedasticity, and (2)
  it is data-driven and adapts automatically to unknown noise distributions. Furthermore,
  our findings unveil the statistical optimality of nonconvex tensor completion: it
  attains un-improvable estimation accuracy — including both the rates and the pre-constants
  — under i.i.d. Gaussian noise.'
