abstract: Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) demonstrates tremendous
  success in practice, especially when combined with neural networks. Different from
  reinforcement learning, GAIL learns both policy and reward function from expert
  (human) demonstration. Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether
  GAIL with neural networks converges to the globally optimal solution. The major
  difﬁculty comes from the nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization structure. To
  bridge the gap between practice and theory, we analyze a gradient-based algorithm
  with alternating updates and establish its sublinear convergence to the globally
  optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the global
  optimality and convergence rate of GAIL with neural networks for the ﬁrst time.
