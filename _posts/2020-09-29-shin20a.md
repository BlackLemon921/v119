abstract: The bias of the sample means of the arms in multi-armed bandits is an important
  issue in adaptive data analysis that has recently received considerable attention
  in the literature. Existing results relate in precise ways the sign and magnitude
  of the bias to various sources of data adaptivity, but do not apply to the conditional
  inference setting in which the sample means are computed only if some specific conditions
  are satisfied. In this paper, we characterize the sign of the conditional bias of
  monotone functions of the rewards, including the sample mean. Our results hold for
  arbitrary conditioning events and leverage natural monotonicity properties of the
  data collection policy. We further demonstrate, through several examples from sequential
  testing and best arm identification, that the sign of the conditional and marginal
  bias of the sample mean of an arm can be different, depending on the conditioning
  event. Our analysis offers new and interesting perspectives on the subtleties of
  assessing the bias in data adaptive settings.
