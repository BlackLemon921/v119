abstract: A Relational Markov Decision Process (RMDP) is a first-order representation
  to express all instances of a single probabilistic planning domain with possibly
  unbounded number of objects. Early work in RMDPs outputs generalized (instance-independent)
  first-order policies or value functions as a means to solve all instances of a domain
  at once. Unfortunately, this line of work met with limited success due to inherent
  limitations of the representation space used in such policies or value functions.
  Can neural models provide the missing link by easily representing more complex generalized
  policies, thus making them effective on all instances of a given domain? We present
  SymNet, the first neural approach for solving RMDPs that are expressed in the probabilistic
  planning language of RDDL. SymNet trains a set of shared parameters for an RDDL
  domain using training instances from that domain. For each instance, SymNet first
  converts it to an instance graph and then uses relational neural models to compute
  node embeddings. It then scores each ground action as a function over the first-order
  action symbols and node embeddings related to the action. Given a new test instance
  from the same domain, SymNet architecture with pre-trained parameters scores each
  ground action and chooses the best action. This can be accomplished in a single
  forward pass without any retraining on the test instance, thus implicitly representing
  a neural generalized policy for the whole domain. Our experiments on nine RDDL domains
  from IPPC demonstrate that SymNet policies are significantly better than random
  and sometimes even more effective than training a state-of-the-art deep reactive
  policy from scratch.
