abstract: We propose a method to fuse posterior distributions learned from heterogeneous
  datasets. Our algorithm relies on a mean field assumption for both the fused model
  and the individual dataset posteriors and proceeds using a simple assign-and-average
  approach. The components of the dataset posteriors are assigned to the proposed
  global model components by solving a regularized variant of the assignment problem.
  The global components are then updated based on these assignments by their mean
  under a KL divergence. For exponential family variational distributions, our formulation
  leads to an efficient non-parametric algorithm for computing the fused model. Our
  algorithm is easy to describe and implement, efficient, and competitive with state-of-the-art
  on motion capture analysis, topic modeling, and federated learning of Bayesian neural
  networks.
