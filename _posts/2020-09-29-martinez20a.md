abstract: In this work we formulate and formally characterize group fairness as a
  multi-objective optimization problem, where each sensitive group risk is a separate
  objective. We propose a fairness criterion where a classifier achieves minimax risk
  and is Pareto-efficient w.r.t. all groups, avoiding unnecessary harm, and can lead
  to the best zero-gap model if policy dictates so. We provide a simple optimization
  algorithm compatible with deep neural networks to satisfy these constraints. Since
  our method does not require test-time access to sensitive attributes, it can be
  applied to reduce worst-case classification errors between outcomes in unbalanced
  classification problems. We test the proposed methodology on real case-studies of
  predicting income, ICU patient mortality, skin lesions classification, and assessing
  credit risk, demonstrating how our framework compares favorably to other approaches.
