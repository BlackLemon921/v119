abstract: Data augmentation is a powerful technique to improve performance in applications
  such as image and text classification tasks. Yet, there is little rigorous understanding
  of why and how various augmentations work. In this work, we consider a family of
  linear transformations and study their effects on the ridge estimator in an over-parametrized
  linear regression setting. First, we show that transformations which preserve the
  labels of the data can improve estimation by enlarging the span of the training
  data. Second, we show that transformations which mix data can improve estimation
  by playing a regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights
  on MNIST. Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches
  over the space of transformations by how \emph{uncertain} the model is about the
  transformed data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For
  example, our method outperforms RandAugment by 1.24% on CIFAR-100 using Wide-ResNet-28-10.
  Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA Adversarial AutoAugment
  on CIFAR datasets.
