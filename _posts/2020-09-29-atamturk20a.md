abstract: We give safe screening rules to eliminate variables from regression with
  $\ell_0$ regularization or cardinality constraint. These rules are based on guarantees
  that a feature may or may not be selected in an optimal solution. The screening
  rules can be computed from a convex relaxation solution in linear time, without
  solving the L0-optimization problem. Thus, they can be used in a preprocessing step
  to safely remove variables from consideration apriori. Numerical experiments on
  real and synthetic data indicate that a significant number of the variables can
  be removed quickly, hence reducing the computational burden for optimization substantially.
  Therefore, the proposed fast and effective screening rules extend the scope of algorithms
  for L0-regression to larger data sets.
