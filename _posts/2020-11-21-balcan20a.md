abstract: 'Automating algorithm configuration is growing increasingly necessary as
  algorithms come with more and more tunable parameters. It is common to tune parameters
  using machine learning, optimizing algorithmic performance (runtime or solution
  quality, for example) using a training set of problem instances from the specific
  domain at hand. We investigate a fundamental question about these techniques: how
  large should the training set be to ensure that a parameter’s average empirical
  performance over the training set is close to its expected, future performance?
  We answer this question for algorithm configuration problems that exhibit a widely-applicable
  structure: the algorithm’s performance as a function of its parameters can be approximated
  by a “simple” function. We show that if this approximation holds under the L$\infty$-norm,
  we can provide strong sample complexity bounds, but if the approximation holds only
  under the Lp-norm for p < $\infty$, it is not possible to provide meaningful sample
  complexity bounds in the worst case. We empirically evaluate our bounds in the context
  of integer programming, obtaining sample complexity bounds that are up to 700 times
  smaller than the previously best-known bounds.'
