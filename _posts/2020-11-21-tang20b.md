abstract: 'This paper is concerned with statistical estimation of two preferential
  attachment models: the Buckley-Osthus model and the block preferential attachment
  model. We prove that the maximum likelihood estimates for both models are consistent.
  We perform simulation studies to corroborate our theoretical findings. We also apply
  both models to study the evolution of a real-world network. A list of open problems
  are presented.'
