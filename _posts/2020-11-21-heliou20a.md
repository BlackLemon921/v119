abstract: Motivated by applications to online advertising and recommender systems,
  we consider a game-theoretic model with delayed rewards and asynchronous, payoff-based
  feedback. In contrast to previous work on delayed multi-armed bandits, we focus
  on games with continuous action spaces, and we examine the long-run behavior of
  strategic agents that follow a no-regret learning policy (but are otherwise oblivious
  to the game being played, the objectives of their opponents, etc.). To account for
  the lack of a consistent stream of information (for instance, rewards can arrive
  out of order and with an a priori unbounded delay), we introduce a gradient-free
  learning policy where payoff information is placed in a priority queue as it arrives.
  Somewhat surprisingly, we find that under a standard diagonal concavity assumption,
  the induced sequence of play converges to Nash Equilibrium (NE) with probability
  1, even if the delay between choosing an action and receiving the corresponding
  reward is unbounded.
