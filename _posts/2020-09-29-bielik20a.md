abstract: 'Machine learning and deep learning in particular has been recently used
  to successfully address many tasks in the domain of code such as finding and fixing
  bugs, code completion, decompilation, type inference and many others. However, the
  issue of adversarial robustness of models for code has gone largely unnoticed. In
  this work, we explore this issue by: (i) instantiating adversarial attacks for code
  (a domain with discrete and highly structured inputs), (ii) showing that, similar
  to other domains, neural models for code are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
  and (iii) combining existing and novel techniques to improve robustness while preserving
  high accuracy.'
