abstract: In this paper we introduce a new approach to topic modelling that scales
  to large datasets by using a compact representation of the data and by leveraging
  the GPU architecture. In this approach, topics are learned directly from the co-occurrence
  data of the corpus. In particular, we introduce a novel mixture model which we term
  the Full Dependence Mixture (FDM) model. FDMs model second moment under general
  generative assumptions on the data. While there is previous work on topic modeling
  using second moments, we develop a direct stochastic optimization procedure for
  fitting an FDM with a single Kullback Leibler objective. Moment methods in general
  have the benefit that an iteration no longer needs to scale with the size of the
  corpus. Our approach allows us to leverage standard optimizers and GPUs for the
  problem of topic modeling. In particular, we evaluate the approach on two large
  datasets, NeurIPS papers and a Twitter corpus, with a large number of topics, and
  show that the approach performs comparably or better than the standard benchmarks.
