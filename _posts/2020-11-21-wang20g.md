abstract: We describe a framework for constructing nonstationary nonseparable random
  fields based on an infinite mixture of convolved stochastic processes. When the
  mixing process is stationary but the convolution function is nonstationary we arrive
  at nonseparable kernels with constant non-separability that are available in closed
  form. When the mixing is nonstationary and the convolution function is stationary
  we arrive at nonseparable random fields that have varying nonseparability and better
  preserve local structure. These fields have natural interpretations through the
  spectral representation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and are demonstrated
  on a range of synthetic benchmarks and spatio-temporal applications in geostatistics
  and machine learning. We show how a single Gaussian process (GP) with these random
  fields can computationally and statistically outperform both separable and existing
  nonstationary nonseparable approaches such as treed GPs and deep GP constructions.
