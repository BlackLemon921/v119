abstract: It is increasingly common to encounter data in the form of cross-sectional
  population measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings. Recent attempts
  to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport to create
  pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot model non-linear
  paths common in many underlying dynamic systems. We establish a link between continuous
  normalizing flows and dynamic optimal transport to model the expected paths of points
  over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they
  are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution.
  We present \emph{TrajectoryNet}, which controls the continuous paths taken between
  distributions. We show how this is particularly applicable for studying cellular
  dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that
  TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal transport-based models
  that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.
