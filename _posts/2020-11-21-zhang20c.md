abstract: Efficiently computing equilibria for multiplayer games is still an open
  challenge in computational game theory. This paper focuses on computing Team-Maxmin
  Equilibria (TMEs), which is an important solution concept for zero-sum multiplayer
  games where players in a team having the same utility function play against an adversary
  independently. Existing algorithms are inefficient to compute TMEs in large games,
  especially when the strategy space is too large to be represented due to limited
  memory. In two-player games, the Incremental Strategy Generation (ISG) algorithm
  is an efficient approach to avoid enumerating all pure strategies. However, the
  study of ISG for computing TMEs is completely unexplored. To fill this gap, we first
  study the properties of ISG for multiplayer games, showing that ISG converges to
  a Nash Equilibrium (NE) but may not converge to a TME. Second, we design an ISG
  variant for TMEs (ISGT) by exploiting that a TME is an NE maximizing the teamâ€™s
  utility and show that ISGT converges to a TME and the impossibility of relaxing
  conditions in ISGT. Third, to further improve the scalability, we design an ISGT
  variant (CISGT) by using the strategy space for computing an equilibrium that is
  close to a TME but is easier to be computed as the initial strategy space of ISGT.
  Finally, extensive experimental results show that CISGT is orders of magnitude faster
  than ISGT and the state-of-the-art algorithm to compute TMEs in large games.
