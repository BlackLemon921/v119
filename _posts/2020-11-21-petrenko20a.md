abstract: 'Increasing the scale of reinforcement learning experiments has allowed
  researchers to achieve unprecedented results in both training sophisticated agents
  for video games, and in sim-to-real transfer for robotics. Typically such experiments
  rely on large distributed systems and require expensive hardware setups, limiting
  wider access to this exciting area of research. In this work we aim to solve this
  problem by optimizing the efficiency and resource utilization of reinforcement learning
  algorithms instead of relying on distributed computation. We present the "Sample
  Factory", a high-throughput training system optimized for a single-machine setting.
  Our architecture combines a highly efficient, asynchronous, GPU-based sampler with
  off-policy correction techniques, allowing us to achieve throughput higher than
  $10^5$ environment frames/second on non-trivial control problems in 3D without sacrificing
  sample efficiency. We extend Sample Factory to support self-play and population-based
  training and apply these techniques to train highly capable agents for a multiplayer
  first-person shooter game. Github: https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory'
