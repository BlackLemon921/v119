abstract: 'We study the question of how to imitate tasks across domains with discrepancies
  such as embodiment, viewpoint, and dynamics mismatch. Many prior works require paired,
  aligned demonstrations and an additional RL step that requires environment interactions.
  However, paired, aligned demonstrations are seldom obtainable and RL procedures
  are expensive. In this work, we formalize the Domain Adaptive Imitation Learning
  (DAIL) problem - a unified framework for imitation learning in the presence of viewpoint,
  embodiment, and/or dynamics mismatch. Informally, DAIL is the process of learning
  how to perform a task optimally, given demonstrations of the task in a distinct
  domain. We propose a two step approach to DAIL: alignment followed by adaptation.
  In the alignment step we execute a novel unsupervised MDP alignment algorithm, Generative
  Adversarial MDP Alignment (GAMA), to learn state and action correspondences from
  \emph{unpaired, unaligned} demonstrations. In the adaptation step we leverage the
  correspondences to zero-shot imitate tasks across domains. To describe when DAIL
  is feasible via alignment and adaptation, we introduce a theory of MDP alignability.
  We experimentally evaluate GAMA against baselines in embodiment, viewpoint, and
  dynamics mismatch scenarios where aligned demonstrations donâ€™t exist and show the
  effectiveness of our approach'
