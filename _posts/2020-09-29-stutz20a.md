abstract: Adversarial training yields robust models against a specific threat model,
  e.g., $L_\infty$ adversarial examples. Typically robustness does not generalize
  to previously unseen threat models, e.g., other $L_p$ norms, or larger perturbations.
  Our confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) tackles this problem by biasing
  the model towards low confidence predictions on adversarial examples. By allowing
  to reject examples with low confidence, robustness generalizes beyond the threat
  model employed during training. CCAT, trained only on $L_\infty$ adversarial examples,
  increases robustness against larger $L_\infty$, $L_2$, $L_1$ and $L_0$ attacks,
  adversarial frames, distal adversarial examples and corrupted examples and yields
  better clean accuracy compared to adversarial training. For thorough evaluation
  we developed novel white- and black-box attacks directly attacking CCAT by maximizing
  confidence. For each threat model, we use $7$ attacks with up to $50$ restarts and
  $5000$ iterations and report worst-case robust test error, extended to our confidence-thresholded
  setting, across all attacks.
