abstract: Although ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide insights for designing
  network architectures, its relationship with the non-residual convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) is still unclear. In this paper, we present a novel ODE model by
  adding a damping term. It can be shown that the proposed model can recover both
  a ResNet and a CNN by adjusting an interpolation coefficient. Therefore, the damped
  ODE model provides a unified framework for the interpretation of residual and non-residual
  networks. The Lyapunov analysis reveals better stability of the proposed model,
  and thus yields robustness improvement of the learned networks. Experiments on a
  number of image classification benchmarks show that the proposed model substantially
  improves the accuracy of ResNet and ResNeXt over the perturbed inputs from both
  stochastic noise and adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the loss landscape analysis
  demonstrates the improved robustness of our method along the attack direction.
