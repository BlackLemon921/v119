abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a well established paradigm for jointly learning
  models for multiple correlated tasks. Often the tasks conflict, requiring trade-offs
  between them during optimization. In such cases, multi-objective optimization based
  MTL methods can be used to find one or more Pareto optimal solutions. A common requirement
  in MTL applications, that cannot be addressed by these methods, is to find a solution
  satisfying userspecified preferences with respect to task-specific losses. We advance
  the state-of-the-art by developing the first gradient-based multi-objective MTL
  algorithm to solve this problem. Our unique approach combines multiple gradient
  descent with carefully controlled ascent to traverse the Pareto front in a principled
  manner, which also makes it robust to initialization. The scalability of our algorithm
  enables its use in large-scale deep networks for MTL. Assuming only differentiability
  of the task-specific loss functions, we provide theoretical guarantees for convergence.
  Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the best competing methods on
  benchmark datasets.
