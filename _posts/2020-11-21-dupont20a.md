abstract: We propose a framework for learning neural scene representations directly
  from images, without 3D supervision. Our key insight is that 3D structure can be
  imposed by ensuring that the learned representation transforms like a real 3D scene.
  Specifically, we introduce a loss which enforces equivariance of the scene representation
  with respect to 3D transformations. Our formulation allows us to infer and render
  scenes in real time while achieving comparable results to models requiring minutes
  for inference. In addition, we introduce two challenging new datasets for scene
  representation and neural rendering, including scenes with complex lighting and
  backgrounds. Through experiments, we show that our model achieves compelling results
  on these datasets as well as on standard ShapeNet benchmarks.
