abstract: 'We present and investigate a novel application domain for deep reinforcement
  learning (RL): droplet routing on digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). A DMFB,
  composed of a two-dimensional electrode array, manipulates discrete fluid droplets
  to automatically execute biochemical protocols such as point-of-care clinical diagnosis.
  However, a major concern associated with the use of DMFBs is that electrodes in
  a biochip can degrade over time. Droplet-transportation operations associated with
  the degraded electrodes can fail, thereby compromising the integrity of the bioassay
  outcome. We show that casting droplet transportation as an RL problem enables the
  training of deep network policies to capture the underlying health conditions of
  electrodes and to provide reliable fluidic operations. We propose a new RL-based
  droplet-routing flow that can be used for various sizes of DMFBs, and demonstrate
  reliable execution of an epigenetic bioassay with the RL droplet router on a fabricated
  DMFB. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based
  on the OpenAI Gym Interface for RL-guided droplet-routing problems on DMFBs.'
