abstract: We consider an agent that is assigned with a temporal logic task in an environment
  whose semantic representation is only partially known. We represent the semantics
  of the environment with a set of state properties, called \emph{atomic propositions}
  over which, the agent holds a probabilistic belief and updates it as new sensory
  measurements arrive. The goal is to design a joint perception and planning strategy
  for the agent that realizes the task with high probability. We develop a planning
  strategy that takes the semantic uncertainties into account and by doing so provides
  probabilistic guarantees on the task success. Furthermore, as new data arrive, the
  belief over the atomic propositions evolves and, subsequently, the planning strategy
  adapts accordingly. We evaluate the proposed method on various finite-horizon tasks
  in planar navigation settings where the empirical results show that the proposed
  method provides reliable task performance that also improves as the knowledge about
  the environment enhances.
