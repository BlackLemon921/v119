abstract: We propose a novel Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (a. k. a. conditional gradient)
  algorithm for constrained smooth finite-sum minimization with a generalized linear
  prediction/structure. This class of problems includes empirical risk minimization
  with sparse, low-rank, or other structured constraints. The proposed method is simple
  to implement, does not require step-size tuning, and has a constant per-iteration
  cost that is independent of the dataset size. Furthermore, as a byproduct of the
  method we obtain a stochastic estimator of the Frank-Wolfe gap that can be used
  as a stopping criterion. Depending on the setting, the proposed method matches or
  improves on the best computational guarantees for Stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms.
  Benchmarks on several datasets highlight different regimes in which the proposed
  method exhibits a faster empirical convergence than related methods. Finally, we
  provide an implementation of all considered methods in an open-source package.
