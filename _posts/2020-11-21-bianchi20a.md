abstract: Spectral clustering (SC) is a popular clustering technique to find strongly
  connected communities on a graph. SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster.
  However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering
  results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization
  for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that
  addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized
  minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this
  objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute
  the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly
  evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design
  a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art
  graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised
  and unsupervised tasks.
