abstract: We study the computational and statistical tradeoffs in inferring combinatorial
  structures of high dimensional simple zero-field ferromagnetic Ising model. Under
  the framework of oracle computational model where an algorithm interacts with an
  oracle that discourses a randomized version of truth, we characterize the computational
  lower bounds of learning combinatorial structures in polynomial time, under which
  no algorithms within polynomial-time can distinguish between graphs with and without
  certain structures. This hardness of learning with limited computational budget
  is shown to be characterized by a novel quantity called vertex overlap ratio. Such
  quantity is universally valid for many specific graph structures including cliques
  and nearest neighbors. On the other side, we attain the optimal rates for testing
  these structures against empty graph by proposing the quadratic testing statistics
  to match the lower bounds. We also investigate the relationship between computational
  bounds and information-theoretic bounds for such problems, and found gaps between
  the two boundaries in inferring some particular structures, especially for those
  with dense edges.
