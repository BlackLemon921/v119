abstract: 'Many computer vision applications require solving multiple tasks in real-time.
  A neural network can be trained to solve multiple tasks simultaneously using multi-task
  learning. This can save computation at inference time as only a single network needs
  to be evaluated. Unfortunately, this often leads to inferior overall performance
  as task objectives can compete, which consequently poses the question: which tasks
  should and should not be learned together in one network when employing multi-task
  learning? We study task cooperation and competition in several different learning
  settings and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such
  that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing
  tasks are computed by different networks. Our framework offers a time-accuracy trade-off
  and can produce better accuracy using less inference time than not only a single
  large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks.'
