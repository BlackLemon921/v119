abstract: 'Randomized Newton methods have recently become the focus of intense research
  activity in large-scale and distributed optimization. In general, these methods
  are based on a “computation-accuracy trade-off”, which allows the user to gain scalability
  in exchange for error in the solution. However, the user does not know how much
  error is created by the randomized approximation, which can be detrimental in two
  ways: On one hand, the user may try to assess the unknown error with theoretical
  worst-case error bounds, but this approach is impractical when the bounds involve
  unknown constants, and it often leads to excessive computation. On the other hand,
  the user may select the “sketch size” and stopping criteria in a heuristic manner,
  but this can lead to unreliable results. Motivated by these difficulties, we show
  how bootstrapping can be used to directly estimate the unknown error, which prevents
  excessive computation, and offers more confidence about the quality of a randomized
  solution.'
