abstract: 'Lifelong learning has recently attracted attention in building machine
  learning systems that continually accumulate and transfer knowledge to help future
  learning. Unsupervised topic modeling has been popularly used to discover topics
  from document collections. However, the application of topic modeling is challenging
  due to data sparsity, e.g., in a small collection of (short) documents and thus,
  generate incoherent topics and sub-optimal document representations. To address
  the problem, we propose a lifelong learning framework for neural topic modeling
  that can continuously process streams of document collections, accumulate topics
  and guide future topic modeling tasks by knowledge transfer from several sources
  to better deal with the sparse data. In the lifelong process, we particularly investigate
  jointly: (1) sharing generative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer
  prior knowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past learning
  via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic regularization approaches.
  Given a stream of document collections, we apply the proposed Lifelong Neural Topic
  Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three sparse document collections as future
  tasks and demonstrate improved performance quantiÔ¨Åed by perplexity, topic coherence
  and information retrieval task. Code: https://github.com/pgcool/Lifelong-Neural-Topic-Modeling'
