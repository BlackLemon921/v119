abstract: Cooperative multi-agent decision making involves a group of agents cooperatively
  solving learning problems while communicating over a network with delays. In this
  paper, we consider the kernelised contextual bandit problem, where the reward obtained
  by an agent is an arbitrary linear function of the contexts’ images in the related
  reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a group of agents must cooperate to
  collectively solve their unique decision problems. For this problem, we propose
  Coop-KernelUCB, an algorithm that provides near-optimal bounds on the per-agent
  regret, and is both computationally and communicatively efficient. For special cases
  of the cooperative problem, we also provide variants of Coop-KernelUCB that provides
  optimal per-agent regret. In addition, our algorithm generalizes several existing
  results in the multi-agent bandit setting. Finally, on a series of both synthetic
  and real-world multi-agent network benchmarks, we demonstrate that our algorithm
  significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.
