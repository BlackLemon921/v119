abstract: 'Graph-based approaches are empirically shown to be very successful for
  the nearest neighbor search (NNS). However, there has been very little research
  on their theoretical guarantees. We fill this gap and rigorously analyze the performance
  of graph-based NNS algorithms, specifically focusing on the low-dimensional ($d
  \ll \log n$) regime. In addition to the basic greedy algorithm on nearest neighbor
  graphs, we also analyze the most successful heuristics commonly used in practice:
  speeding up via adding shortcut edges and improving accuracy via maintaining a dynamic
  list of candidates. We believe that our theoretical insights supported by experimental
  analysis are an important step towards understanding the limits and benefits of
  graph-based NNS algorithms.'
