abstract: Deep neural networks have been proven to be vulnerable to the so-called
  adversarial attacks. Recently there have been efforts to defend such attacks with
  deep generative models. These defenses often predict by inverting the deep generative
  models rather than simple feedforward propagation. Such defenses are difficult to
  attack due to the obfuscated gradients caused by inversion. In this work, we propose
  a new white-box attack to break these defenses. The idea is to view the inversion
  phase as a dynamical system, through which we extract the gradient w.r.t the image
  by backtracking its trajectory. An amortized strategy is also developed to accelerate
  the attack. Experiments show that our attack better breaks state-of-the-art defenses
  (e.g DefenseGAN, ABS) than other attacks (e.g BPDA). Additionally, our empirical
  results provide insights for understanding the weaknesses of deep generative model
  defenses.
