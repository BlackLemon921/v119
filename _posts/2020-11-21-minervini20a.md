abstract: Attempts to render deep learning models interpretable, data-efficient, and
  robust have seen some success through hybridisation with rule-based systems, for
  example, in Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs). These neuro-symbolic models can induce
  interpretable rules and learn representations from data via back-propagation, while
  providing logical explanations for their predictions. However, they are restricted
  by their computational complexity, as they need to consider all possible proof paths
  for explaining a goal, thus rendering them unfit for large-scale applications. We
  present Conditional Theorem Provers (CTPs), an extension to NTPs that learns an
  optimal rule selection strategy via gradient-based optimisation. We show that CTPs
  are scalable and yield state-of-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which tests
  systematic generalisation of neural models by learning to reason over smaller graphs
  and evaluating on larger ones. Finally, CTPs show better link prediction results
  on standard benchmarks in comparison with other neural-symbolic models, while being
  explainable.
