abstract: Providing users with alternatives to choose from is an essential component
  of many online platforms, making the accurate prediction of choice vital to their
  success. A renewed interest in learning choice models has led to improved modeling
  power, but most current methods are either limited in the type of choice behavior
  they capture, cannot be applied to large-scale data, or both. Here we propose a
  learning framework for predicting choice that is accurate, versatile, and theoretically
  grounded. Our key modeling point is that to account for how humans choose, predictive
  models must be expressive enough to accommodate complex choice patterns but structured
  enough to retain statistical efficiency. Building on recent results in economics,
  we derive a class of models that achieves this balance, and propose a neural implementation
  that allows for scalable end-to-end training. Experiments on three large choice
  datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.
