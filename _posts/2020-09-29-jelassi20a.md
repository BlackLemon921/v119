abstract: Data-driven modeling increasingly requires to find a Nash equilibrium in
  multi-player games, e.g. when training GANs. In this paper, we analyse a new extra-gradient
  method for Nash equilibrium finding, that performs gradient extrapolations and updates
  on a random subset of players at each iteration. This approach provably exhibits
  a better rate of convergence than full extra-gradient for non-smooth convex games
  with noisy gradient oracle. We propose an additional variance reduction mechanism
  to obtain speed-ups in smooth convex games. Our approach makes extrapolation amenable
  to massive multiplayer settings, and brings empirical speed-ups, in particular when
  using a heuristic cyclic sampling scheme.Â Most importantly, it allows to train faster
  and better GANs and mixtures of GANs.
