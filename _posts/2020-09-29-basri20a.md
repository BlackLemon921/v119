abstract: Recent works have partly attributed the generalization ability of over-parameterized
  neural networks to frequency bias â€“ networks trained with gradient descent on data
  drawn from a uniform distribution find a low frequency fit before high frequency
  ones. As realistic training sets are not drawn from a uniform distribution, we here
  use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) model to explore the effect of variable density
  on training dynamics. Our results, which combine analytic and empirical observations,
  show that when learning a pure harmonic function of frequency $\kappa$, convergence
  at a point $x \in \S^{d-1}$ occurs in time $O(\kappa^d/p(x))$ where $p(x)$ denotes
  the local density at $x$. Specifically, for data in $\S^1$ we analytically derive
  the eigenfunctions of the kernel associated with the NTK for two-layer networks.
  We further prove convergence results for deep, fully connected networks with respect
  to the spectral decomposition of the NTK. Our empirical study highlights similarities
  and differences between deep and shallow networks in this model.
