abstract: An open question in systems and computational neuroscience is how neural
  circuits accumulate evidence towards a decision. Fitting models of decision-making
  theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but current approaches limit
  the number of these models that we can fit to neural data. Here we propose a general
  framework for modeling neural activity during decision-making. The framework includes
  the canonical drift-diffusion model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional
  accumulators, variable and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework
  is based on constraining the parameters of recurrent state space models, for which
  we introduce a scalable variational Laplace EM inference algorithm. We applied the
  modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex during
  two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator better captured
  the responses of a set of parietal neurons than a single accumulator model, and
  we identified a variable lower boundary in the responses of a parietal neuron during
  a random dot motion task. We expect this framework will be useful for modeling neural
  dynamics in a variety of decision-making settings.
