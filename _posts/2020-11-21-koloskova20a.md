abstract: Decentralized stochastic optimization methods have gained a lot of attention
  recently, mainly because of their cheap per iteration cost, data locality, and their
  communication-efficiency. In this paper we introduce a unified convergence analysis
  that covers a large variety of decentralized SGD methods which so far have required
  different intuitions, have different applications, and which have been developed
  separately in various communities. Our algorithmic framework covers local SGD updates
  and synchronous and pairwise gossip updates on adaptive network topology. We derive
  universal convergence rates for smooth (convex and non-convex) problems and the
  rates interpolate between the heterogeneous (non-identically distributed data) and
  iid-data settings, recovering linear convergence rates in many special cases, for
  instance for over-parametrized models. Our proofs rely on weak assumptions (typically
  improving over prior work in several aspects) and recover (and improve) the best
  known complexity results for a host of important scenarios, such as for instance
  coorperative SGD and federated averaging (local SGD).
