abstract: We report a series of robust empirical observations, demonstrating that
  deep Neural Networks learn the examples in both the training and test sets in a
  similar order. This phenomenon is observed in all the commonly used benchmarks we
  evaluated, including many image classification benchmarks, and one text classification
  benchmark. While this phenomenon is strongest for models of the same architecture,
  it also crosses architectural boundaries – models of different architectures start
  by learning the same examples, after which the more powerful model may continue
  to learn additional examples. We further show that this pattern of results reflects
  the interplay between the way neural networks learn benchmark datasets. Specifically,
  when fixing the architecture, we describe synthetic datasets for which this pattern
  is no longer observed. When fixing the dataset, we show that other learning paradigms
  may learn the data in a different order. We hypothesize that our results reflect
  how neural networks discover structure in natural datasets.
