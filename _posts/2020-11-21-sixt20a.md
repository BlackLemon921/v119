abstract: 'Attribution methods aim to explain a neural networkâ€™s prediction by highlighting
  the most relevant image areas. A popular approach is to backpropagate (BP) a custom
  relevance score using modified rules, rather than the gradient. We analyze an extensive
  set of modified BP methods: Deep Taylor Decomposition, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
  (LRP), Excitation BP, PatternAttribution, DeepLIFT, Deconv, RectGrad, and Guided
  BP. We find empirically that the explanations of all mentioned methods, except for
  DeepLIFT, are independent of the parameters of later layers. We provide theoretical
  insights for this surprising behavior and also analyze why DeepLIFT does not suffer
  from this limitation. Empirically, we measure how information of later layers is
  ignored by using our new metric, cosine similarity convergence (CSC). The paper
  provides a framework to assess the faithfulness of new and existing modified BP
  methods theoretically and empirically.'
