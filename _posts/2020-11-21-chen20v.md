abstract: 'Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach
  for graph-structured data. Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior
  performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success,
  most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the \emph{over-smoothing} problem.
  In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional
  networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple
  yet effective techniques: \emph{Initial residual} and \emph{Identity mapping}. We
  provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves
  the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks.'
