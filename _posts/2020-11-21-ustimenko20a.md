abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce a powerful and efficient framework for direct
  optimization of ranking metrics. The problem is ill-posed due to the discrete structure
  of the loss, and to deal with that, we introduce two important techniques: stochastic
  smoothing and novel gradient estimate based on partial integration. We show that
  classic smoothing approaches may introduce bias and present a universal solution
  for a proper debiasing. Importantly, we can guarantee global convergence of our
  method by adopting a recently proposed Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting algorithm.
  Our algorithm is implemented as a part of the CatBoost gradient boosting library
  and outperforms the existing approaches on several learning-to-rank datasets. In
  addition to ranking metrics, our framework applies to any scale-free discrete loss
  function.'
