abstract: We develop two new stochastic Gauss-Newton algorithms for solving a class
  of non-convex stochastic compositional optimization problems frequently arising
  in practice. We consider both the expectation and finite-sum settings under standard
  assumptions, and use both classical stochastic and SARAH estimators for approximating
  function values and Jacobians. In the expectation case, we establish $\BigO{\varepsilon^{-2}}$
  iteration-complexity to achieve a stationary point in expectation and estimate the
  total number of stochastic oracle calls for both function value and its Jacobian,
  where $\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. In the finite sum case, we also estimate
  $\BigO{\varepsilon^{-2}}$ iteration-complexity and the total oracle calls with high
  probability. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such global stochastic
  oracle complexity is established for stochastic Gauss-Newton methods. Finally, we
  illustrate our theoretical results via two numerical examples on both synthetic
  and real datasets.
