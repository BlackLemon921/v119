abstract: 'We study multinomial logit bandit with limited adaptivity, where the algorithms
  change their exploration actions as infrequently as possible when achieving almost
  optimal minimax regret. We propose two measures of adaptivity: the assortment switching
  cost and the more fine-grained item switching cost. We present an anytime algorithm
  (AT-DUCB) with $O(N \log T)$ assortment switches, almost matching the lower bound
  $\Omega(\frac{N \log T}{ \log \log T})$. In the fixed-horizon setting, our algorithm
  FH-DUCB incurs $O(N \log \log T)$ assortment switches, matching the asymptotic lower
  bound. We also present the ESUCB algorithm with item switching cost $O(N \log^2
  T)$.'
