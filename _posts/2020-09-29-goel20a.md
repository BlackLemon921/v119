abstract: We give the first superpolynomial lower bounds for learning one-layer neural
  networks with respect to the Gaussian distribution for a broad class of algorithms.
  In the regression setting, we prove that gradient descent run on any classifier
  with respect to square loss will fail to achieve small test error in polynomial
  time. Prior work held only for gradient descent run with small batch sizes and sufficiently
  smooth classifiers. For classification, we give a stronger result, namely that any
  statistical query (SQ) algorithm will fail to achieve small test error in polynomial
  time. Our lower bounds hold for commonly used activations such as ReLU and sigmoid.
  The core of our result relies on a novel construction of a simple family of neural
  networks that are exactly orthogonal with respect to all spherically symmetric distributions.
