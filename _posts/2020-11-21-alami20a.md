abstract: "we consider the problem of sequential change-point detection where \tboth
  the change-points and the distributions before and after the change are assumed
  to be unknown. For this problem of primary importance in statistical and sequential
  learning theory, we derive a variant of the Bayesian Online Change Point Detector
  proposed by \\cite{fearnhead2007line} \twhich is easier to analyze than the original
  version while keeping its powerful message-passing algorithm. \tWe provide a non-asymptotic
  analysis of the false-alarm rate and the detection delay that matches the existing
  lower-bound. We further provide the first explicit high-probability control of the
  detection delay for such approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
  show that this proposal outperforms the state-of-art change-point detection strategy,
  namely the Improved Generalized Likelihood Ratio (Improved GLR) while compares favorably
  with the original Bayesian Online Change Point Detection strategy."
