abstract: Exploration is widely regarded as one of the most challenging aspects of
  reinforcement learning (RL), with many naive approaches succumbing to exponential
  sample complexity. To isolate the challenges of exploration, we propose the following
  “reward-free RL” framework. In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories
  from an MDP $M$ without a pre-specified reward function. After exploration, it is
  tasked with computing a near-policies under the transitions of $\mathcal{M}$ for
  a collection of given reward functions. This framework is particularly suitable
  where there are many reward functions of interest, or where the reward function
  is shaped by an external agent to elicit desired behavior. We give an efficient
  algorithm that conducts $\widetilde{O}(S^2A\mathrm{poly}(H)/\epsilon^2)$ episodes
  of exploration, and returns $\epsilon$-suboptimal policies for an arbitrary number
  of reward functions. We achieve this by finding exploratory policies that jointly
  visit each “significant” state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation
  probability under any possible policy. Moreover, our planning procedure can be instantiated
  by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or natural policy
  gradient. Finally, we give a nearly-matching $\Omega(S^2AH^2/\epsilon^2)$ lower
  bound, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm in this setting.
