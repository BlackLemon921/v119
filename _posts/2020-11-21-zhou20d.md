abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages unlabeled data when training a
  model with insufficient labeled data. A common strategy for SSL is to enforce the
  consistency of model outputs between similar samples, e.g., neighbors or data augmentations
  of the same sample. However, model outputs can vary dramatically on unlabeled data
  over different training stages, e.g., when using large learning rates. This can
  introduce harmful noises and inconsistent objectives over time that may lead to
  concept drift and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we study the dynamics
  of neural net outputs in SSL and show that selecting and using first the unlabeled
  samples with more consistent outputs over the course of training (i.e., "time-consistency")
  can improve the final test accuracy and save computation. Under the time-consistent
  data selection, we design an SSL objective composed of two self-supervised losses,
  i.e., a consistency loss between a sample and its augmentation, and a contrastive
  loss encouraging different samples to have different outputs. Our approach achieves
  SOTA on several SSL benchmarks with much fewer computations.
