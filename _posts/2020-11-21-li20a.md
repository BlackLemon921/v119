abstract: 'Understanding the dependencies among features of a dataset is at the core
  of most unsupervised learning tasks. However, a majority of generative modeling
  approaches are focused solely on the joint distribution $p(x)$ and utilize models
  where it is intractable to obtain the conditional distribution of some arbitrary
  subset of features $x_u$ given the rest of the observed covariates $x_o$: $p(x_u
  \mid x_o)$. Traditional conditional approaches provide a model for a \emph{fixed}
  set of covariates conditioned on another \emph{fixed} set of observed covariates.
  Instead, in this work we develop a model that is capable of yielding \emph{all}
  conditional distributions $p(x_u \mid x_o)$ (for arbitrary $x_u$) via tractable
  conditional likelihoods. We propose a novel extension of (change of variables based)
  flow generative models, arbitrary conditioning flow models (ACFlow). ACFlow can
  be conditioned on arbitrary subsets of observed covariates, which was previously
  infeasible. We further extend ACFlow to model the joint distributions $p(x)$ and
  arbitrary marginal distributions $p(x_u)$. We also apply ACFlow to the imputation
  of features, and develop a unified platform for both multiple and single imputation
  by introducing an auxiliary objective that provides a principled single “best guess”
  for flow models. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in modeling arbitrary conditional likelihoods in addition to both single
  and multiple imputation in synthetic and real-world datasets.'
