abstract: Group invariant and equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), also known
  as Equivariant Networks and Group Group Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNN) have
  achieved remarkable success in learning on a variety of data structures, such as
  sequences, images, sets, and graphs. This paper proves the universality of a broad
  class of equivariant MLPs with a single hidden layer. In particular, it is shown
  that having a hidden layer on which the group acts regularly is sufficient for universal
  equivariance (invariance). For example, some types of steerable-CNNâ€™s become universal.
  Another corollary is the unconditional universality of equivariant MLPs for all
  Abelian groups. A third corollary is the universality of equivariant MLPs with a
  high-order hidden layer, where we give both group-agnostic bounds and group-specific
  bounds on the order of the hidden layer that guarantees universal equivariance.
