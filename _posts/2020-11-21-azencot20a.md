abstract: Recurrent neural networks are widely used on time series data, yet such
  models often ignore the underlying physical structures in such sequences. A new
  class of physics-based methods related to Koopman theory has been introduced, offering
  an alternative for processing nonlinear dynamical systems. In this work, we propose
  a novel Consistent Koopman Autoencoder model which, unlike the majority of existing
  work, leverages the forward and backward dynamics. Key to our approach is a new
  analysis which explores the interplay between consistent dynamics and their associated
  Koopman operators. Our network is directly related to the derived analysis, and
  its computational requirements are comparable to other baselines. We evaluate our
  method on a wide range of high-dimensional and short-term dependent problems, and
  it achieves accurate estimates for significant prediction horizons, while also being
  robust to noise.
