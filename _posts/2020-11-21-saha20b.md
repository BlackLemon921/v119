abstract: We consider PAC learning a good item from $k$-subsetwise feedback sampled
  from a Plackett-Luce probability model, with instance-dependent sample complexity
  performance. In the setting where subsets of a fixed size can be tested and top-ranked
  feedback is made available to the learner, we give an optimal instance-dependent
  algorithm with a sample complexity bound for PAC best arm identification algorithm
  of $O\bigg(\frac{\Theta_{[k]}}{k}\sum_{i = 2}^n\max\Big(1,\frac{1}{\Delta_i^2}\Big)
  \ln\frac{k}{\delta}\Big(\ln \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\Big)\bigg)$, $\Delta_i$ being the
  Plackett-Luce parameter gap between the best and the $i^{th}$ best item, and $\Theta_{[k]}$
  is the sum of the Plackett-Luce parameters for top-$k$ items. The algorithm is based
  on a wrapper around a PAC winner-finding algorithm with weaker performance guarantees
  to adapt to the hardness of the input instance. The sample complexity is also shown
  to be multiplicatively better depending on the length of rank-ordered feedback available
  in each subset-wise play. We show optimality of our algorithms with matching sample
  complexity lower bounds. We next address the winner-finding problem in Plackett-Luce
  models in the fixed-budget setting with instance dependent upper and lower bounds
  on the misidentification probability, of $\Omega\left(\exp(-2 \tilde \Delta Q) \right)$
  for a given budget $Q$, where $\tilde \Delta$ is an explicit instance-dependent
  problem complexity parameter. Numerical performance results are also reported for
  the algorithms.
