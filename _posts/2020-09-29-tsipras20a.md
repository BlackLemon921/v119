abstract: Building rich machine learning datasets in a scalable manner often necessitates
  a crowd-sourced data collection pipeline. In this work, we use human studies to
  investigate the consequences of employing such a pipeline, focusing on the popular
  ImageNet dataset. We study how specific design choices in the ImageNet creation
  process impact the fidelity of the resulting datasetâ€”including the introduction
  of biases that state-of-the-art models exploit. Our analysis pinpoints how a noisy
  data collection pipeline can lead to a systematic misalignment between the resulting
  benchmark and the real-world task it serves as a proxy for. Finally, our findings
  emphasize the need to augment our current model training and evaluation toolkit
  to take such misalignment into account.
