abstract: Integer programming is a general optimization framework with a wide variety
  of applications, e.g., in scheduling, production planning, and graph optimization.
  As Integer Programs (IPs) model many provably hard to solve problems, modern IP
  solvers rely on heuristics. These heuristics are often human-designed, and tuned
  over time using experience and data. The goal of this work is to show that the performance
  of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular,
  we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane
  Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present
  a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive
  selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show
  that our trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and
  effectively generalizes to larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained
  agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting
  plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art
  commercial IP solvers.
