abstract: While the impact of variational inference (VI) on posterior inference in
  a fixed generative model is well-characterized, its role in regularizing a learned
  generative model when used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) is poorly understood.
  We study the regularizing effects of variational distributions on learning in generative
  models from two perspectives. First, we analyze the role that the choice of variational
  family plays in imparting uniqueness to the learned model by restricting the set
  of optimal generative models. Second, we study the regularization effect of the
  variational family on the local geometry of the decoding model. This analysis uncovers
  the regularizer implicit in the $\beta$-VAE objective, and leads to an approximation
  consisting of a deterministic autoencoding objective plus analytic regularizers
  that depend on the Hessian or Jacobian of the decoding model, unifying VAEs with
  recent heuristics proposed for training regularized autoencoders. We empirically
  verify these findings, observing that the proposed deterministic objective exhibits
  similar behavior to the $\beta$-VAE in terms of objective value and sample quality.
