abstract: Tokenization is the first step of many natural language processing (NLP)
  tasks and plays an important role for neural NLP models. Tokenizaton method such
  as byte-pair encoding (BPE), which can greatly reduce the large vocabulary and deal
  with out-of-vocabulary words, has shown to be effective and is widely adopted for
  sequence generation tasks. While various tokenization methods exist, there is no
  common acknowledgement which is the best. In this work, we propose to leverage the
  mixed representations from different tokenization methods for sequence generation
  tasks, in order to boost the model performance with unique characteristics and advantages
  of individual tokenization methods. Specifically, we introduce a new model architecture
  to incorporate mixed representations and a co-teaching algorithm to better utilize
  the diversity of different tokenization methods. Our approach achieves significant
  improvements on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks with six language pairs (e.g.,
  English$\leftrightarrow$German, English$\leftrightarrow$Romanian), as well as an
  abstractive summarization task.
