abstract: We study regularization in the context of small sample-size learning with
  over-parametrized neural networks. Specifically, we shift focus from architectural
  properties, such as norms on the network weights, to properties of the internal
  representations before a linear classifier. Specifically, we impose a topological
  constraint on samples drawn from the probability measure induced in that space.
  This provably leads to mass concentration effects around the representations of
  training instances, i.e., a property beneficial for generalization. By leveraging
  previous work to impose topological constrains in a neural network setting, we provide
  empirical evidence (across various vision benchmarks) to support our claim for better
  generalization.
