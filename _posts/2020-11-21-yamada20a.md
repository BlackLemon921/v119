abstract: Feature selection problems have been extensively studied in the setting
  of linear estimation (e.g. LASSO), but less emphasis has been placed on feature
  selection for non-linear functions. In this study, we propose a method for feature
  selection in neural network estimation problems. The new procedure is based on probabilistic
  relaxation of the $\ell_0$ norm of features, or the count of the number of selected
  features. Our $\ell_0$-based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of
  the Bernoulli distribution; such relaxation allows our model to learn the parameters
  of the approximate Bernoulli distributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework
  simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while
  selecting a small subset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justification
  for incorporating Bernoulli distribution into feature selection. Furthermore, we
  evaluate our method using synthetic and real-life data to demonstrate that our approach
  outperforms other commonly used methods in both predictive performance and feature
  selection.
