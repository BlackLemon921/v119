abstract: 'Robust loss functions are essential for training accurate deep neural networks
  (DNNs) in the presence of noisy (incorrect) labels. It has been shown that the commonly
  used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions
  have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically
  show by applying a simple normalization that: \emph{any loss can be made robust
  to noisy labels}. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for
  a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions,
  we find that they suffer from a problem of \emph{underfitting}. To address this,
  we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called \emph{Active Passive
  Loss} (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other.
  Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the family of new loss functions
  created by our APL framework can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods
  by large margins, especially under large noise rates such as 60% or 80% incorrect
  labels.'
