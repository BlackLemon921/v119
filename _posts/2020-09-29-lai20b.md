abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning approaches leverage a forward dynamics
  model to support planning and decision making, which, however, may fail catastrophically
  if the model is inaccurate. Although there are several existing methods dedicated
  to combating the model error, the potential of the single forward model is still
  limited. In this paper, we propose to additionally construct a backward dynamics
  model to reduce the reliance on accuracy in forward model predictions. We develop
  a novel method, called Bidirectional Model-based Policy Optimization (BMPO) to utilize
  both the forward model and backward model to generate short branched rollouts for
  policy optimization. Furthermore, we theoretically derive a tighter bound of return
  discrepancy, which shows the superiority of BMPO against the one using merely the
  forward model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BMPO outperforms state-of-the-art
  model-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.
