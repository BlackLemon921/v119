abstract: Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, recently attracting
  increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements
  of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given
  to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries.
  That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to
  multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a
  principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize
  the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to
  the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We
  further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for
  Symmetric Elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and
  equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally,
  we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of
  experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds.
