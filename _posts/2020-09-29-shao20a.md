abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically constructed by stacking
  multiple building blocks, each of which contains a normalization layer such as batch
  normalization (BN) and a rectified linear function such as ReLU. However, this work
  shows that the combination of normalization and rectified linear function leads
  to inhibited channels, which have small magnitude and contribute little to the learned
  feature representation, impeding the generalization ability of CNNs. Unlike prior
  arts that simply removed the inhibited channels, we propose to “wake them up” during
  training by designing a novel neural building block, termed Channel Equilibrium
  (CE) block, which enables channels at the same layer to contribute equally to the
  learned representation. We show that CE is able to prevent inhibited channels both
  empirically and theoretically. CE has several appealing benefits. (1) It can be
  integrated into many advanced CNN architectures such as ResNet and MobileNet, outperforming
  their original networks. (2) CE has an interesting connection with the Nash Equilibrium,
  a well-known solution of a non-cooperative game. (3) Extensive experiments show
  that CE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks
  such as ImageNet and COCO.
