abstract: Generative flows models enjoy the properties of tractable exact likelihood
  and efficient sampling, which are composed of a sequence of invertible functions.
  In this paper, we incorporate matrix exponential into generative flows. Matrix exponential
  is a map from matrices to invertible matrices, this property is suitable for generative
  flows. Based on matrix exponential, we propose matrix exponential coupling layers
  that are a general case of affine coupling layers and matrix exponential invertible
  1 x 1 convolutions that do not collapse during training. And we modify the networks
  architecture to make training stable and significantly speed up the training process.
  Our experiments show that our model achieves great performance on density estimation
  amongst generative flows models.
