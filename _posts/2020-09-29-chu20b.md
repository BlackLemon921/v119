abstract: The structured sparsity-inducing $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm, as a generalization
  of the classical $\ell_1$-norm, plays an important role in jointly sparse models
  which select or remove simultaneously all the variables forming a group. However,
  its resulting problem is more difficult to solve than the conventional $\ell_1$-norm
  constrained problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for Euclidean
  projection onto $\ell_{1, \infty}$-norm ball. We tackle the projection problem via
  semismooth Newton algorithm to solve the system of semismooth equations. Meanwhile,
  exploiting the structure of the Jacobian matrix via LU decomposition yields an equivalent
  algorithm which is proved to terminate after a finite number of iterations. Empirical
  studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
  solver and is promising for the optimization of learning problems with the $\ell_{1,
  \infty}$-norm ball constraint.
