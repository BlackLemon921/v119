abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) represent the given data in a low-dimensional
  latent space, which is generally assumed to be Euclidean. This assumption naturally
  leads to the common choice of a standard Gaussian prior over continuous latent variables.
  Recent work has, however, shown that this prior has a detrimental effect on model
  capacity, leading to subpar performance. We propose that the Euclidean assumption
  lies at the heart of this failure mode. To counter this, we assume a Riemannian
  structure over the latent space, which constitutes a more principled geometric view
  of the latent codes, and replace the standard Gaussian prior with a Riemannian Brownian
  motion prior. We propose an efficient inference scheme that does not rely on the
  unknown normalizing factor of this prior. Finally, we demonstrate that this prior
  significantly increases model capacity using only one additional scalar parameter.
