abstract: We propose a neural information processing system obtained by re-purposing
  the function of a biological neural circuit model to govern simulated and real-world
  control tasks. Inspired by the structure of the nervous system of the soil-worm,
  C. elegans, we introduce ordinary neural circuits (ONCs), defined as the model of
  biological neural circuits reparameterized for the control of alternative tasks.
  We first demonstrate that ONCs realize networks with higher maximum flow compared
  to arbitrary wired networks. We then learn instances of ONCs to control a series
  of robotic tasks, including the autonomous parking of a real-world rover robot.
  For reconfiguration of the purpose of the neural circuit, we adopt a search-based
  optimization algorithm. Ordinary neural circuits perform on par and, in some cases,
  significantly surpass the performance of contemporary deep learning models. ONC
  networks are compact, 77% sparser than their counterpart neural controllers, and
  their neural dynamics are fully interpretable at the cell-level.
