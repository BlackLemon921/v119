abstract: 'Cross-domain alignment between two sets of entities (e.g., objects in an
  image, words in a sentence) is fundamental to both computer vision and natural language
  processing. Existing methods mainly focus on designing advanced attention mechanisms
  to simulate soft alignment, where no training signals are provided to explicitly
  encourage alignment. Plus, the learned attention matrices are often dense and difficult
  to interpret. We propose Graph Optimal Transport (GOT), a principled framework that
  builds upon recent advances in Optimal Transport (OT). In GOT, cross-domain alignment
  is formulated as a graph matching problem, by representing entities as a dynamically-constructed
  graph. Two types of OT distances are considered: (i) Wasserstein distance (WD) for
  node (entity) matching; and (ii) Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) for edge (structure)
  matching. Both WD and GWD can be incorporated into existing neural network models,
  effectively acting as a drop-in regularizer. The inferred transport plan also yields
  sparse and self-normalized alignment, enhancing the interpretability of the learned
  model. Experiments show consistent outperformance of GOT over baselines across a
  wide range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering,
  image captioning, machine translation, and text summarization.'
