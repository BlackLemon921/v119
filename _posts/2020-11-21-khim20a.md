abstract: The decision-theoretic foundations of classical machine learning models
  have largely focused on estimating model parameters that minimize the expectation
  of a given loss function. However, as machine learning models are deployed in varied
  contexts, such as in high-stakes decision-making and societal settings, it is clear
  that these models are not just evaluated by their average performances. In this
  work, we study a novel notion of L-Risk based on the classical idea of rank-weighted
  learning. These L-Risks, induced by rank-dependent weighting functions with bounded
  variation, is a unification of popular risk measures such as conditional value-at-risk
  and those defined by cumulative prospect theory. We give uniform convergence bounds
  of this broad class of risk measures and study their consequences on a logistic
  regression example.
