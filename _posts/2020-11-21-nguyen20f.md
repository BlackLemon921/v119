abstract: Maximizing on k-submodular functions subject to size constraint has received
  extensive attention recently. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic scenario
  of this problem that (1) obtaining exact evaluation of an objective function is
  impractical, instead, its noisy version is acquired; and (2) algorithms are required
  to take only one single pass over dataset, producing solutions in a timely manner.
  We propose two novel streaming algorithms, namely DStream and RStream, with their
  theoretical performance guarantees. We further demonstrate the efficiency of our
  algorithms in two application, showing that our algorithms can return comparative
  results to state-of-the-art non-streaming methods while using a much fewer number
  of queries.
