abstract: 'Recent advances in maximizing mutual information (MI) between the source
  and target have demonstrated its effectiveness in text generation. However, previous
  works paid little attention to modeling the backward network of MI (i.e., dependency
  from the target to the source), which is crucial to the tightness of the variational
  information maximization lower bound. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mutual
  Information (AMI): a text generation framework which is formed as a novel saddle
  point (min-max) optimization aiming to identify joint interactions between the source
  and target. Within this framework, the forward and backward networks are able to
  iteratively promote or demote each otherâ€™s generated instances by comparing the
  real and synthetic data distributions. We also develop a latent noise sampling strategy
  that leverages random variations at the high-level semantic space to enhance the
  long term dependency in the generation process. Extensive experiments based on different
  text generation tasks demonstrate that the proposed AMI framework can significantly
  outperform several strong baselines, and we also show that AMI has potential to
  lead to a tighter lower bound of maximum mutual information for the variational
  information maximization problem.'
