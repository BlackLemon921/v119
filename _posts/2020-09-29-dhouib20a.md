abstract: 'The Optimal transport (OT) problem and its associated Wasserstein distance
  have recently become a topic of great interest in the machine learning community.
  However, the underlying optimization problem is known to have two major restrictions:
  (i) it largely depends on the choice of the cost function and (ii) its sample complexity
  scales exponentially with the dimension. In this paper, we propose a general formulation
  of a minimax OT problem that can tackle these restrictions by jointly optimizing
  the cost matrix and the transport plan, allowing us to define a robust distance
  between distributions. We propose to use a cutting-set method to solve this general
  problem and show its links and advantages compared to other existing minimax OT
  approaches. Additionally, we use this method to define a notion of stability allowing
  us to select the most robust cost matrix. Finally, we provide an experimental study
  highlighting the efficiency of our approach.'
