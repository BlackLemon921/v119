abstract: The choice of the control frequency of a system has a relevant impact on
  the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a highly performing policy.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of action persistence that consists in the
  repetition of an action for a fixed number of decision steps, having the effect
  of modifying the control frequency. We start analyzing how action persistence affects
  the performance of the optimal policy, and then we present a novel algorithm, Persistent
  Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), that extends FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal
  value function at a given persistence. After having provided a theoretical study
  of PFQI and a heuristic approach to identify the optimal persistence, we present
  an experimental campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence
  and proving the effectiveness of our persistence selection method.
