abstract: We study the model selection problem in \emph{conditional average treatment
  effect} (CATE) prediction. Unlike previous works on this topic, we focus on preserving
  the rank order of the performance of candidate CATE predictors to enable accurate
  and stable model selection. To this end, we analyze the model performance ranking
  problem and formulate guidelines to obtain a better evaluation metric. We then propose
  a novel metric that can identify the ranking of the performance of CATE predictors
  with high confidence. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our metric outperforms
  existing metrics in both model selection and hyperparameter tuning tasks.
