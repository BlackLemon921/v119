abstract: Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly
  structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent deep
  generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains that are
  indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper introduces a
  Bayesian approach to source separation that uses deep generative models as priors
  over the components of a mixture of sources, and noise-annealed Langevin dynamics
  to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples
  the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly
  use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new methodology for evaluating
  separation quality on richer datasets, providing quantitative evaluation and qualitative
  discussion of results for CIFAR-10 image separation. We also provide qualitative
  results on LSUN.
