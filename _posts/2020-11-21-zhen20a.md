abstract: We introduce kernels with random Fourier features in the meta-learning framework
  for few-shot learning. We propose meta variational random features (MetaVRF) to
  learn adaptive kernels for the base-learner, which is developed in a latent variable
  model by treating the random feature basis as the latent variable. We formulate
  the optimization of MetaVRF as a variational inference problem by deriving an evidence
  lower bound under the meta-learning framework. To incorporate shared knowledge from
  related tasks, we propose a context inference of the posterior, which is established
  by an LSTM architecture. The LSTM-based inference network can effectively integrate
  the context information of previous tasks with task-specific information, generating
  informative and adaptive features. The learned MetaVRF can produce kernels of high
  representational power with a relatively low spectral sampling rate and also enables
  fast adaptation to new tasks. Experimental results on a variety of few-shot regression
  and classification tasks demonstrate that MetaVRF delivers much better, or at least
  competitive, performance compared to existing meta-learning alternatives.
