abstract: 'Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandit problems is known to enjoy favorable
  performance in both theory and practice. However, its wider deployment is restricted
  due to a significant computational limitation: the need for samples from posterior
  distributions at every iteration. In practice, this limitation is alleviated by
  making use of approximate sampling methods, yet provably incorporating approximate
  samples into Thompson Sampling algorithms remains an open problem. In this work
  we address this by proposing two efficient Langevin MCMC algorithms tailored to
  Thompson sampling. The resulting approximate Thompson Sampling algorithms are efficiently
  implementable and provably achieve optimal instance-dependent regret for the Multi-Armed
  Bandit (MAB) problem. To prove these results we derive novel posterior concentration
  bounds and MCMC convergence rates for log-concave distributions which may be of
  independent interest.'
