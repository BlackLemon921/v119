abstract: This paper investigates generalisation in multi-agent games, where the generality
  of the agent can be evaluated by playing against opponents it hasn’t seen during
  training. We propose two new games with concealed information and complex, non-transitive
  reward structure (think rock-paper-scissors). It turns out that most current deep
  reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently explore the strategy space, thus
  learning policies that generalise poorly to unseen opponents. We then propose a
  novel hierarchical agent architecture, where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic
  structure of the game – the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents,
  while the low level implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding
  facilitates credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show
  that the proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents,
  while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.
