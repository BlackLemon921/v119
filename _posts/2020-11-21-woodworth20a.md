abstract: We study local SGD (also known as parallel SGD and federated SGD), a natural
  and frequently used distributed optimization method. Its theoretical foundations
  are currently lacking and we highlight how all existing error guarantees in the
  convex setting are dominated by a simple baseline, minibatch SGD. (1) For quadratic
  objectives we prove that local SGD strictly dominates minibatch SGD and that accelerated
  local SGD is minmax optimal for quadratics; (2) For general convex objectives we
  provide the first guarantee that at least \emph{sometimes} improves over minibatch
  SGD, but our guarantee does not always improve over, nor even match, minibatch SGD;
  (3) We show that indeed local SGD does \emph{not} dominate minibatch SGD by presenting
  a lower bound on the performance of local SGD that is worse than the minibatch SGD
  guarantee.
