abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning is known to be memory and computation
  efficient and more amendable to large scale problems. In this paper, two model-free
  algorithms are introduced for learning infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision
  Processes (MDPs). The first algorithm reduces the problem to the discounted-reward
  version and achieves $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret after $T$ steps, under the minimal
  assumption of weakly communicating MDPs. To our knowledge, this is the first model-free
  algorithm for general MDPs in this setting. The second algorithm makes use of recent
  advances in adaptive algorithms for adversarial multi-armed bandits and improves
  the regret to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, albeit with a stronger ergodic assumption.
  This result significantly improves over the $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret achieved
  by the only existing model-free algorithm by Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2019) for ergodic
  MDPs in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting.
