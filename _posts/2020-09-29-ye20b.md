abstract: Recent empirical works show that large deep neural networks are often highly
  redundant and one can find much smaller subnetworks without a significant drop of
  accuracy. However, most existing methods of network pruning are empirical and heuristic,
  leaving it open whether good subnetworks provably exist, how to find them efficiently,
  and if network pruning can be provably better than direct training using gradient
  descent. We answer these problems positively by proposing a simple greedy selection
  approach for finding good subnetworks, which starts from an empty network and greedily
  adds important neurons from the large network. This differs from the existing methods
  based on backward elimination, which remove redundant neurons from the large network.
  Theoretically, applying the greedy selection strategy on sufficiently large {pre-trained}
  networks guarantees to find small subnetworks with lower loss than networks directly
  trained with gradient descent. Our results also apply to pruning randomly weighted
  networks. Practically, we improve prior arts of network pruning on learning compact
  neural architectures on ImageNet, including ResNet, MobilenetV2/V3, and ProxylessNet.
  Our theory and empirical results on MobileNet suggest that we should fine-tune the
  pruned subnetworks to leverage the information from the large model, instead of
  re-training from new random initialization as suggested in \citet{liu2018rethinking}.
