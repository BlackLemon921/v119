abstract: Typical architectures of Generative Adversarial Networks make use of a unimodal
  latent/input distribution transformed by a continuous generator. Consequently, the
  modeled distribution always has connected support which is cumbersome when learning
  a disconnected set of manifolds. We formalize this problem by establishing a "no
  free lunch" theorem for the disconnected manifold learning stating an upper-bound
  on the precision of the targeted distribution. This is done by building on the necessary
  existence of a low-quality region where the generator continuously samples data
  between two disconnected modes. Finally, we derive a rejection sampling method based
  on the norm of generator’s Jacobian and show its efficiency on several generators
  including BigGAN.
