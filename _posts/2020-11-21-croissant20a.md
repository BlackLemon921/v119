abstract: In display advertising, a small group of sellers and bidders face each other
  in up to $10^{12}$ auctions a day. In this context, revenue maximisation via monopoly
  price learning is a high-value problem for sellers. By nature, these auctions are
  online and produce a very high frequency stream of data. This results in a computational
  strain that requires algorithms be real-time. Unfortunately, existing methods inherited
  from the batch setting suffer $O(\sqrt{t})$ time/memory complexity at each update,
  prohibiting their use. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm for online
  learning of monopoly prices in online auctions whose update is constant in time
  and memory.
