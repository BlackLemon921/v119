abstract: In self-supervised visual representation learning, a feature extractor is
  trained on a "pretext task" for which labels can be generated cheaply, without human
  annotation. A central challenge in this approach is that the feature extractor quickly
  learns to exploit low-level visual features such as color aberrations or watermarks
  and then fails to learn useful semantic representations. Much work has gone into
  identifying such "shortcut" features and hand-designing schemes to reduce their
  effect. Here, we propose a general framework for mitigating the effect shortcut
  features. Our key assumption is that those features which are the first to be exploited
  for solving the pretext task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained
  to make the task harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext
  tasks and datasets by training a "lens" network to make small image changes that
  maximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with the
  modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases. Additionally,
  the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of pretext task and dataset
  affects the features learned by self-supervision.
