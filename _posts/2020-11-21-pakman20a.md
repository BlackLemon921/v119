abstract: Probabilistic clustering models (or equivalently, mixture models) are basic
  building blocks in countless statistical models and involve latent random variables
  over discrete spaces. For these models, posterior inference methods can be inaccurate
  and/or very slow. In this work we introduce deep network architectures trained with
  labeled samples from any generative model of clustered datasets. At test time, the
  networks generate approximate posterior samples of cluster labels for any new dataset
  of arbitrary size. We develop two complementary approaches to this task, requiring
  either O(N) or O(K) network forward passes per dataset, where N is the dataset size
  and K the number of clusters. Unlike previous approaches, our methods sample the
  labels of all the data points from a well-defined posterior, and can learn nonparametric
  Bayesian posteriors since they do not limit the number of mixture components. As
  a scientific application, we present a novel approach to neural spike sorting for
  high-density multielectrode arrays.
