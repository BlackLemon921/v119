abstract: Human observers can learn to recognize new categories of images from a handful
  of examples, yet doing so with artificial ones remains an open challenge. We hypothesize
  that data-efficient recognition is enabled by representations which make the variability
  in natural signals more predictable. We therefore revisit and improve Contrastive
  Predictive Coding, an unsupervised objective for learning such representations.
  This new implementation produces features which support state-of-the-art linear
  classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. When used as input for non-linear
  classification with deep neural networks, this representation allows us to use 2-5x
  less labels than classifiers trained directly on image pixels. Finally, this unsupervised
  representation substantially improves transfer learning to object detection on the
  PASCAL VOC dataset, surpassing fully supervised pre-trained ImageNet classifiers.
