abstract: The generalized linear bandit framework has attracted a lot of attention
  in recent years by extending the well-understood linear setting and allowing to
  model richer reward structures. It notably covers the logistic model, widely used
  when rewards are binary. For logistic bandits, the frequentist regret guarantees
  of existing algorithms are $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa \sqrt{T})$, where $\kappa$
  is a problem-dependent constant. Unfortunately, $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large
  as it scales exponentially with the size of the decision set. This may lead to significantly
  loose regret bounds and poor empirical performance. In this work, we study the logistic
  bandit with a focus on the prohibitive dependencies introduced by $\kappa$. We propose
  a new optimistic algorithm based on a finer examination of the non-linearities of
  the reward function. We show that it enjoys a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret
  with no dependency in $\kappa$, but for a second order term. Our analysis is based
  on a new tail-inequality for self-normalized martingales, of independent interest.
