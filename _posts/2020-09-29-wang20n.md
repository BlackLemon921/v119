abstract: 'In multi-label learning, each instance can be associated with multiple
  and non-exclusive labels. Previous studies assume that all the labels in the learning
  process are fixed and static; however, they ignore the fact that the labels will
  emerge continuously in changing environments. In order to fill in these research
  gaps, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based framework, Deep Streaming
  Label Learning (DSLL), to classify instances with newly emerged labels effectively.
  DSLL can explore and incorporate the knowledge from past labels and historical models
  to understand and develop emerging new labels. DSLL consists of three components:
  1) a streaming label mapping to extract deep relationships between new labels and
  past labels with a novel label-correlation aware loss; 2) a streaming feature distillation
  propagating feature-level knowledge from the historical model to a new model; 3)
  a senior student network to model new labels with the help of knowledge learned
  from the past. Theoretically, we prove that DSLL admits tight generalization error
  bounds for new labels in the DNN framework. Experimentally, extensive empirical
  results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the existing
  state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods to handle the continually emerging
  new labels.'
