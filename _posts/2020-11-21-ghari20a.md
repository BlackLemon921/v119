abstract: Multi-kernel learning (MKL) exhibits reliable performance in nonlinear function
  approximation tasks. Instead of using one kernel, it learns the optimal kernel from
  a pre-selected dictionary of kernels. The selection of the dictionary has crucial
  impact on both the performance and complexity of MKL. Specifically, inclusion of
  a large number of irrelevant kernels may impair the accuracy, and increase the complexity
  of MKL algorithms. To enhance the accuracy, and alleviate the computational burden,
  the present paper develops a novel scheme which actively chooses relevant kernels.
  The proposed framework models the pruned kernel combination as feedback collected
  from a graph, that is refined ’on the fly.’ Leveraging the random feature approximation,
  we propose an online scalable multi-kernel learning approach with graph feedback,
  and prove that the proposed algorithm enjoys sublinear regret. Numerical tests on
  real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel approach.
