abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a scalable algorithm to preserve differential
  privacy (DP) in adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs), with certified
  robustness to adversarial examples. By leveraging the sequential composition theory
  in DP, we randomize both input and latent spaces to strengthen our certified robustness
  bounds. To address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness,
  we design an original adversarial objective function, based on the post-processing
  property in DP, to tighten the sensitivity of our model. A new stochastic batch
  training is proposed to apply our mechanism on large DNNs and datasets, by bypassing
  the vanilla iterative batch-by-batch training in DP DNNs. An end-to-end theoretical
  analysis and evaluations show that our mechanism notably improves the robustness
  and scalability of DP DNNs.
