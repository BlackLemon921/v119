abstract: Humans intuitively recognize objectsâ€™ physical properties and predict their
  motion, even when the objects are engaged in complicated interactions. The abilities
  to perform physical reasoning and to adapt to new environments, while intrinsic
  to humans, remain challenging to state-of-the-art computational models. In this
  work, we present a neural model that simultaneously reasons about physics and makes
  future predictions based on visual and dynamics priors. The visual prior predicts
  a particle-based representation of the system from visual observations. An inference
  module operates on those particles, predicting and refining estimates of particle
  locations, object states, and physical parameters, subject to the constraints imposed
  by the dynamics prior, which we refer to as visual grounding. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our method in environments involving rigid objects, deformable
  materials, and fluids. Experiments show that our model can infer the physical properties
  within a few observations, which allows the model to quickly adapt to unseen scenarios
  and make accurate predictions into the future.
