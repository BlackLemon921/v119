abstract: We introduce a new approach for comparing reinforcement learning policies,
  using Wasserstein distances (WDs) in a newly defined latent behavioral space. We
  show that by utilizing the dual formulation of the WD, we can learn score functions
  over policy behaviors that can in turn be used to lead policy optimization towards
  (or away from) (un)desired behaviors. Combined with smoothed WDs, the dual formulation
  allows us to devise efficient algorithms that take stochastic gradient descent steps
  through WD regularizers. We incorporate these regularizers into two novel on-policy
  algorithms, Behavior-Guided Policy Gradient and Behavior-Guided Evolution Strategies,
  which we demonstrate can outperform existing methods in a variety of challenging
  environments. We also provide an open source demo.
