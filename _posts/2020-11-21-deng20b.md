abstract: Replica exchange Monte Carlo (reMC), also known as parallel tempering, is
  an important technique for accelerating the convergence of the conventional Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. However, such a method requires the evaluation
  of the energy function based on the full dataset and is not scalable to big data.
  The na√Øve implementation of reMC in mini-batch settings introduces large biases,
  which cannot be directly extended to the stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC), the
  standard sampling method for simulating from deep neural networks (DNNs). In this
  paper, we propose an adaptive replica exchange SGMCMC (reSGMCMC) to automatically
  correct the bias and study the corresponding properties. The analysis implies an
  acceleration-accuracy trade-off in the numerical discretization of a Markov jump
  process in a stochastic environment. Empirically, we test the algorithm through
  extensive experiments on various setups and obtain the state-of-the-art results
  on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN in both supervised learning and semi-supervised learning
  tasks.
