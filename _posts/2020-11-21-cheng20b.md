abstract: Mutual information (MI) minimization has gained considerable interests in
  various machine learning tasks. However, estimating and minimizing MI in high-dimensional
  spaces remains a challenging problem, especially when only samples, rather than
  distribution forms, are accessible. Previous works mainly focus on MI lower bound
  approximation, which is not applicable to MI minimization problems. In this paper,
  we propose a novel Contrastive Log-ratio Upper Bound (CLUB) of mutual information.
  We provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of CLUB and its variational
  approximation. Based on this upper bound, we introduce a MI minimization training
  scheme and further accelerate it with a negative sampling strategy. Simulation studies
  on Gaussian distributions show the reliable estimation ability of CLUB. Real-world
  MI minimization experiments, including domain adaptation and information bottleneck,
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/CLUB.
