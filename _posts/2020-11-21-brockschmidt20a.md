abstract: 'This paper presents a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) type using feature-wise
  linear modulation (FiLM). Many standard GNN variants propagate information along
  the edges of a graph by computing messages based only on the representation of the
  source of each edge. In GNN-FiLM, the representation of the target node of an edge
  is used to compute a transformation that can be applied to all incoming messages,
  allowing feature-wise modulation of the passed information. Different GNN architectures
  are compared in extensive experiments on three tasks from the literature, using
  re-implementations of many baseline methods. Hyperparameters for all methods were
  found using extensive search, yielding somewhat surprising results: differences
  between state of the art models are much smaller than reported in the literature
  and well-known simple baselines that are often not compared to perform better than
  recently proposed GNN variants. Nonetheless, GNN-FiLM outperforms these methods
  on a regression task on molecular graphs and performs competitively on other tasks.'
