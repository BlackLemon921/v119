abstract: We develop an effective generation of adversarial attacks on neural models
  that output a sequence of probability distributions rather than a sequence of single
  values. This setting includes the recently proposed deep probabilistic autoregressive
  forecasting models that estimate the probability distribution of a time series given
  its past and achieve state-of-the-art results in a diverse set of application domains.
  The key technical challenge we address is how to effectively differentiate through
  the Monte-Carlo estimation of statistics of the output sequence joint distribution.
  Additionally, we extend prior work on probabilistic forecasting to the Bayesian
  setting which allows conditioning on future observations, instead of only on past
  observations. We demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate attacks
  with small input perturbations in two challenging tasks where robust decision making
  is crucial – stock market trading and prediction of electricity consumption.
