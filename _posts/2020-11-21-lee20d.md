abstract: We consider the batch reinforcement learning problem where the agent needs
  to learn only from a fixed batch of data, without further interaction with the environment.
  In such a scenario, we want to prevent the optimized policy from deviating too much
  from the data collection policy since the estimation becomes highly unstable otherwise
  due to the off-policy nature of the problem. However, imposing this requirement
  too strongly will result in a policy that merely follows the data collection policy.
  Unlike prior work where this trade-off is controlled by hand-tuned hyperparameters,
  we propose a novel batch reinforcement learning approach, batch optimization of
  policy and hyperparameter (BOPAH), that uses a gradient-based optimization of the
  hyperparameter using held-out data. We show that BOPAH outperforms other batch reinforcement
  learning algorithms in tabular and continuous control tasks, by finding a good balance
  to the trade-off between adhering to the data collection policy and pursuing the
  possible policy improvement.
