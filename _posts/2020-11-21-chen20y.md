abstract: In this paper, we study Combinatorial Semi-Bandits (CSB) that is an extension
  of classic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) under Differential Privacy (DP) and stronger
  Local Differential Privacy (LDP) setting. Since the server receives more information
  from users in CSB, it usually causes additional dependence on the dimension of data,
  which is a notorious side-effect for privacy preserving learning. However for CSB
  under two common smoothness assumptions, we show it is possible to remove this side-effect.
  In detail, for $B_{\infty}$-bounded smooth CSB under either $\varepsilon$-LDP or
  $\varepsilon$-DP, we prove the optimal regret bound is $\Theta(\frac{mB^2_{\infty}\ln
  T } {\Delta\varepsilon^2})$ or $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{mB^2_{\infty}\ln T} { \Delta\varepsilon})$
  respectively, where $T$ is time period, $\Delta$ is the gap of rewards and $m$ is
  the number of base arms, by proposing novel algorithms and matching lower bounds.
  For $B_1$-bounded smooth CSB under $\varepsilon$-DP, we also prove the optimal regret
  bound is $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{mKB^2_1\ln T} {\Delta\varepsilon})$ with both upper
  bound and lower bound, where $K$ is the maximum number of feedback in each round.
  All above results nearly match corresponding non-private optimal rates, which imply
  there is no additional price for (locally) differentially private CSB in above common
  settings.
