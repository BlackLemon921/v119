abstract: Sampling is a fundamental technique, and sampling without replacement is
  often desirable when duplicate samples are not beneficial. Within machine learning,
  sampling is useful for generating diverse outputs from a trained model. We present
  an elegant procedure for sampling without replacement from a broad class of randomized
  programs, including generative neural models that construct outputs sequentially.
  Our procedure is efficient even for exponentially-large output spaces. Unlike prior
  work, our approach is incremental, i.e., samples can be drawn one at a time, allowing
  for increased flexibility. We also present a new estimator for computing expectations
  from samples drawn without replacement. We show that incremental sampling without
  replacement is applicable to many domains, e.g., program synthesis and combinatorial
  optimization.
