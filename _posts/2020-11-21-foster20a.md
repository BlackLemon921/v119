abstract: A fundamental challenge in contextual bandits is to develop flexible, general-purpose
  algorithms with computational requirements no worse than classical supervised learning
  tasks such as classification and regression. Algorithms based on regression have
  shown promising empirical success, but theoretical guarantees have remained elusive
  except in special cases. We provide the first universal and optimal reduction from
  contextual bandits to online regression. We show how to transform any oracle for
  online regression with a given value function class into an algorithm for contextual
  bandits with the induced policy class, with no overhead in runtime or memory requirements.
  We characterize the minimax rates for contextual bandits with general, potentially
  nonparametric function classes, and show that our algorithm is minimax optimal whenever
  the oracle obtains the optimal rate for regression. Compared to previous results,
  our algorithm requires no distributional assumptions beyond realizability, and works
  even when contexts are chosen adversarially.
