abstract: 'Many AI problems, in robotics and other domains, are goal-directed, essentially
  seeking a trajectory leading to some goal state. Reinforcement learning (RL), building
  on Bellmanâ€™s optimality equation, naturally optimizes for a single goal, yet can
  be made goal-directed by augmenting the state with the goal. Instead, we propose
  a new RL framework, derived from a dynamic programming equation for the all pairs
  shortest path (APSP) problem, which naturally solves goal-directed queries. We show
  that this approach has computational benefits for both standard and approximate
  dynamic programming. Interestingly, our formulation prescribes a novel protocol
  for computing a trajectory: instead of predicting the next state given its predecessor,
  as in standard RL, a goal-conditioned trajectory is constructed by first predicting
  an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the trajectory into two.
  Then, recursively, predicting intermediate points on each sub-segment, until a complete
  trajectory is obtained. We call this trajectory structure a sub-goal tree. Building
  on it, we additionally extend the policy gradient methodology to recursively predict
  sub-goals, resulting in novel goal-based algorithms. Finally, we apply our method
  to neural motion planning, where we demonstrate significant improvements compared
  to standard RL on navigating a 7-DoF robot arm between obstacles.'
