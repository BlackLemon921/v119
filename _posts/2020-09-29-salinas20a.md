abstract: 'Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular methodology to tune the hyperparameters
  of expensive black-box functions. Traditionally, BO focuses on a single task at
  a time and is not designed to leverage information from related functions, such
  as tuning performance objectives of the same algorithm across multiple datasets.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach to achieve transfer learning across
  different datasets as well as different objectives. The main idea is to regress
  the mapping from hyperparameter to objective quantiles with a semi-parametric Gaussian
  Copula distribution, which provides robustness against different scales or outliers
  that can occur in different tasks. We introduce two methods to leverage this estimation:
  a Thompson sampling strategy as well as a Gaussian Copula process using such quantile
  estimate as a prior. We show that these strategies can combine the estimation of
  multiple objectives such as latency and accuracy, steering the optimization toward
  faster predictions for the same level of accuracy. Experiments on an extensive set
  of hyperparameter tuning tasks demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
  methods for both hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.'
