abstract: There has been a growing realization of the potential of Bayesian machine
  learning as a platform that can provide both flexible modeling, accurate predictions
  as well as coherent uncertainty statements. In particular, Bayesian Additive Regression
  Trees (BART) have emerged as one of todayâ€™s most effective general approaches to
  predictive modeling under minimal assumptions. Statistical theoretical developments
  for machine learning have been mostly concerned with approximability or rates of
  estimation when recovering infinite dimensional objects (curves or densities). Despite
  the impressive array of available theoretical results, the literature has been largely
  silent about uncertainty quantification. In this work, we continue the theoretical
  investigation of BART initiated recently by Rockova and van der Pas (2017). We focus
  on statistical inference questions. In particular, we study the Bernstein-von Mises
  (BvM) phenomenon (i.e. asymptotic normality) for smooth linear functionals of the
  regression surface within the framework of non-parametric regression with fixed
  covariates. Our semi-parametric BvM results show that, beyond rate-optimal estimation,
  BART can be also used for valid statistical inference.
