abstract: We demonstrate two new important properties of the 1-path-norm of shallow
  neural networks. First, despite its non-smoothness and non-convexity it allows a
  closed form proximal operator which can be efficiently computed, allowing the use
  of stochastic proximal-gradient-type methods for regularized empirical risk minimization.
  Second, when the activation functions is differentiable, it provides an upper bound
  on the Lipschitz constant of the network. Such bound is tighter than the trivial
  layer-wise product of Lipschitz constants, motivating its use for training networks
  robust to adversarial perturbations. In practical experiments we illustrate the
  advantages of using the proximal mapping and we compare the robustness-accuracy
  trade-off induced by the 1-path-norm, L1-norm and layer-wise constraints on the
  Lipschitz constant (Parseval networks).
