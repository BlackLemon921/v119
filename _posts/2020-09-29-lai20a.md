abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms have become indispensable in modern machine
  learning. An unresolved foundational question in this area is the difference between
  with-replacement sampling and without-replacement sampling — does the latter have
  superior convergence rate compared to the former? A groundbreaking result of Recht
  and Ré reduces the problem to a noncommutative analogue of the arithmetic-geometric
  mean inequality where $n$ positive numbers are replaced by $n$ positive definite
  matrices. If this inequality holds for all $n$, then without-replacement sampling
  (also known as random reshuffling) indeed outperforms with-replacement sampling
  in some important optimization problems. The conjectured Recht–Ré inequality has
  so far only been established for $n = 2$ and a special case of $n = 3$. We will
  show that the Recht–Ré conjecture is false for general $n$. Our approach relies
  on the noncommutative Positivstellensatz, which allows us to reduce the conjectured
  inequality to a semidefinite program and the validity of the conjecture to certain
  bounds for the optimum values, which we show are false as soon as $n = 5$.
