abstract: "We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for repeated second-price
  auctions with reserve where a seller interacts with multiple strategic bidders each
  of which holds a fixed private valuation for a good and seeks to maximize his expected
  future cumulative discounted surplus.\t We propose a novel algorithm that has strategic
  regret upper bound of $O(\\log\\log T)$ for worst-case valuations. This pricing
  is based on our novel transformation that upgrades an algorithm designed for the
  setup with a single buyer to the multi-buyer case. We provide theoretical guarantees
  on the ability of a transformed algorithm to learn the valuation of a strategic
  buyer, which has uncertainty about the future due to the presence of rivals."
