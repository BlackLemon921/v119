abstract: Generative models in molecular design tend to be richly parameterized, data-hungry
  neural models, as they must create complex structured objects as outputs. Estimating
  such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training
  data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach
  for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative
  model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then
  used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative
  model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic
  EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted.
  A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since
  the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant
  gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design.
  In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional
  molecular design by over 10% in absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach
  is useful in other domains as well, such as program synthesis.
