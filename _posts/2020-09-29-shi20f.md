abstract: Deep generative models are commonly used for generating images and text.
  Interpretability of these models is one important pursuit, other than the generation
  quality. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has
  been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning
  of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one
  can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE),
  whose mixture components could be related to hidden semantic aspects of data. In
  this paper, we generalize the practice and introduce DEM-VAE, a class of models
  for text generation using VAEs with a mixture distribution of exponential family.
  Unfortunately, a standard variational training algorithm fails due to the \emph{mode-collapse}
  problem. We theoretically identify the root cause of the problem and propose an
  effective algorithm to train DEM-VAE. Our method penalizes the training with an
  extra \emph{dispersion term} to induce a well-structured latent space. Experimental
  results show that our approach does obtain a meaningful space, and it outperforms
  strong baselines in text generation benchmarks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/wenxianxian/demvae}.
