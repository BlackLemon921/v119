abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a computational approach to fundamental
  problems such as inference, integration, optimization, and simulation. The field
  has developed a broad spectrum of algorithms, varying in the way they are motivated,
  the way they are applied and how efficiently they sample. Despite all the differences,
  many of them share the same core principle, which we unify as the Involutive MCMC
  (iMCMC) framework. Building upon this, we describe a wide range of MCMC algorithms
  in terms of iMCMC, and formulate a number of “tricks” which one can use as design
  principles for developing new MCMC algorithms. Thus, iMCMC provides a unified view
  of many known MCMC algorithms, which facilitates the derivation of powerful extensions.
  We demonstrate the latter with two examples where we transform known reversible
  MCMC algorithms into more efficient irreversible ones.
