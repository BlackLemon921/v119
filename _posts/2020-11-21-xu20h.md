abstract: Many real-world control problems involve conflicting objectives where we
  desire a dense and high-quality set of control policies that are optimal for different
  objective preferences (called Pareto-optimal). While extensive research in multi-objective
  reinforcement learning (MORL) has been conducted to tackle such problems, multi-objective
  optimization for complex continuous robot control is still under-explored. In this
  work, we propose an efficient evolutionary learning algorithm to find the Pareto
  set approximation for continuous robot control problems, by extending a state-of-the-art
  RL algorithm and presenting a novel prediction model to guide the learning process.
  In addition to efficiently discovering the individual policies on the Pareto front,
  we construct a continuous set of Pareto-optimal solutions by Pareto analysis and
  interpolation. Furthermore, we design seven multi-objective RL environments with
  continuous action space, which is the first benchmark platform to evaluate MORL
  algorithms on various robot control problems. We test the previous methods on the
  proposed benchmark problems, and the experiments show that our approach is able
  to find a much denser and higher-quality set of Pareto policies than the existing
  algorithms.
