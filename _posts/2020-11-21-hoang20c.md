abstract: We propose a novel gradient-based tractable approach for the Blahut-Arimoto
  (BA) algorithm to compute the rate-distortion function where the BA algorithm is
  fully parameterized. This results in a rich and flexible framework to learn a new
  class of stochastic encoders, termed PArameterized RAte-DIstortion Stochastic Encoder
  (PARADISE). The framework can be applied to a wide range of settings from semi-supervised,
  multi-task to supervised and robust learning. We show that the training objective
  of PARADISE can be seen as a form of regularization that helps improve generalization.
  With an emphasis on robust learning we further develop a novel posterior matching
  objective to encourage smoothness on the loss function and show that PARADISE can
  significantly improve interpretability as well as robustness to adversarial attacks
  on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our
  model reduces standard and adversarial error rates in comparison to the state-of-the-art
  by 50% and 41%, respectively without the expensive computational cost of adversarial
  training.
