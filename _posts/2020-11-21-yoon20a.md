abstract: 'Quantifying the value of data is a fundamental problem in machine learning
  and has multiple important use cases: (1) building insights about the dataset and
  task, (2) domain adaptation, (3) corrupted sample discovery, and (4) robust learning.
  We propose Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning (DVRL), to adaptively learn
  data values jointly with the predictor model. DVRL uses a data value estimator (DVE)
  to learn how likely each datum is used in training of the predictor model. DVE is
  trained using a reinforcement signal that reflects performance on the target task.
  We demonstrate that DVRL yields superior data value estimates compared to alternative
  methods across numerous datasets and application scenarios. The corrupted sample
  discovery performance of DVRL is close to optimal in many regimes (i.e. as if the
  noisy samples were known apriori), and for domain adaptation and robust learning
  DVRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by 14.6% and 10.8%, respectively.'
