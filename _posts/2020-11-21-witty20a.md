abstract: Latent confounders—unobserved variables that influence both treatment and
  outcome—can bias estimates of causal effects. In some cases, these confounders are
  shared across observations, e.g. all students taking a course are influenced by
  the course’s difficulty in addition to any educational interventions they receive
  individually. This paper shows how to semiparametrically model latent confounders
  that have this structure and thereby improve estimates of causal effects. The key
  innovations are a hierarchical Bayesian model, Gaussian processes with structured
  latent confounders (GP-SLC), and a Monte Carlo inference algorithm for this model
  based on elliptical slice sampling. GP-SLC provides principled Bayesian uncertainty
  estimates of individual treatment effect with minimal assumptions about the functional
  forms relating confounders, covariates, treatment, and outcome. Finally, this paper
  shows GP-SLC is competitive with or more accurate than widely used causal inference
  techniques on three benchmark datasets, including the Infant Health and Development
  Program and a dataset showing the effect of changing temperatures on state-wide
  energy consumption across New England.
