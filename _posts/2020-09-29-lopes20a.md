abstract: In order to compute fast approximations to the singular value decompositions
  (SVD) of very large matrices, randomized sketching algorithms have become a leading
  approach. However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is that the user
  does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are from the exact ones.
  Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical worst-case error bounds, which
  may not account for the unique structure of a given problem. As a result, the lack
  of tools for error estimation often leads to much more computation than is really
  necessary. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven
  bootstrap method that numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular
  vectors/values. Furthermore, the method is computationally inexpensive, because
  it operates only on sketched objects, and hence it requires no extra passes over
  the full matrix being factored.
