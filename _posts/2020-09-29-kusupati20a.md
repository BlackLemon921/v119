abstract: Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is studied extensively with the
  focus of maximizing prediction accuracy given an overall parameter budget. Existing
  methods rely on uniform or heuristic non-uniform sparsity budgets which have sub-optimal
  layer-wise parameter allocation resulting in a) lower prediction accuracy or b)
  higher inference cost (FLOPs). This work proposes Soft Threshold Reparameterization
  (STR), a novel use of the soft-threshold operator on DNN weights. STR smoothly induces
  sparsity while learning pruning thresholds thereby obtaining a non-uniform sparsity
  budget. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for unstructured sparsity
  in CNNs (ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), and, additionally, learns non-uniform
  budgets that empirically reduce the FLOPs by up to 50%. Notably, STR boosts the
  accuracy over existing results by up to 10% in the ultra sparse (99%) regime and
  can also be used to induce low-rank (structured sparsity) in RNNs. In short, STR
  is a simple mechanism which learns effective sparsity budgets that contrast with
  popular heuristics. Code, pretrained models and sparsity budgets are at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/STR.
