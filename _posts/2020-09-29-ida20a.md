abstract: The deterministic CUR matrix decomposition is a low-rank approximation method
  to analyze a data matrix. It has attracted considerable attention due to its high
  interpretability, which results from the fact that the decomposed matrices consist
  of subsets of the original columns and rows of the data matrix. The subset is obtained
  by optimizing an objective function with sparsity-inducing norms via coordinate
  descent. However, the existing algorithms for optimization incur high computation
  costs. This is because coordinate descent iteratively updates all the parameters
  in the objective until convergence. This paper proposes a fast deterministic CUR
  matrix decomposition. Our algorithm safely skips unnecessary updates by efficiently
  evaluating the optimality conditions for the parameters to be zeros. In addition,
  we preferentially update the parameters that must be nonzeros. Theoretically, our
  approach guarantees the same result as the original approach. Experiments demonstrate
  that our algorithm speeds up the deterministic CUR while achieving the same accuracy.
