abstract: Likelihood-free (a.k.a. simulation-based) inference problems are inverse
  problems with expensive, or intractable, forward models. ODE inverse problems are
  commonly treated as likelihood-free, as their forward map has to be numerically
  approximated by an ODE solver. This, however, is not a fundamental constraint but
  just a lack of functionality in classic ODE solvers, which do not return a likelihood
  but a point estimate. To address this shortcoming, we employ Gaussian ODE filtering
  (a probabilistic numerical method for ODEs) to construct a local Gaussian approximation
  to the likelihood. This approximation yields tractable estimators for the gradient
  and Hessian of the (log-)likelihood. Insertion of these estimators into existing
  gradient-based optimization and sampling methods engenders new solvers for ODE inverse
  problems. We demonstrate that these methods outperform standard likelihood-free
  approaches on three benchmark-systems.
