abstract: Intelligent agents should be able to learn useful representations by observing
  changes in their environment. We model such observations as pairs of non-i.i.d.
  images sharing at least one of the underlying factors of variation. First, we theoretically
  show that only knowing how many factors have changed, but not which ones, is sufficient
  to learn disentangled representations. Second, we provide practical algorithms that
  learn disentangled representations from pairs of images without requiring annotation
  of groups, individual factors, or the number of factors that have changed. Third,
  we perform a large-scale empirical study and show that such pairs of observations
  are sufficient to reliably learn disentangled representations on several benchmark
  data sets. Finally, we evaluate our learned representations and find that they are
  simultaneously useful on a diverse suite of tasks, including generalization under
  covariate shifts, fairness, and abstract reasoning. Overall, our results demonstrate
  that weak supervision enables learning of useful disentangled representations in
  realistic scenarios.
