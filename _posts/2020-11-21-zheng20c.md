abstract: To collect large scale annotated data, it is inevitable to introduce label
  noise, i.e., incorrect class labels. To be robust against label noise, many successful
  methods rely on the noisy classifiers (i.e., models trained on the noisy training
  data) to determine whether a label is trustworthy. However, it remains unknown why
  this heuristic works well in practice. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical
  explanation for these methods. We prove that the prediction of a noisy classifier
  can indeed be a good indicator of whether the label of a training data is clean.
  Based on the theoretical result, we propose a novel algorithm that corrects the
  labels based on the noisy classifier prediction. The corrected labels are consistent
  with the true Bayesian optimal classifier with high probability. We incorporate
  our label correction algorithm into the training of deep neural networks and train
  models that achieve superior testing performance on multiple public datasets.
