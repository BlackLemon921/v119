abstract: Graph embeddings are a ubiquitous tool for machine learning tasks, such
  as node classification and link prediction, on graph-structured data. However, computing
  the embeddings for large-scale graphs is prohibitively inefficient even if we are
  interested only in a small subset of relevant vertices. To address this, we present
  an efficient graph coarsening approach, based on Schur complements, for computing
  the embedding of the relevant vertices. We prove that these embeddings are preserved
  exactly by the Schur complement graph that is obtained via Gaussian elimination
  on the non-relevant vertices. As computing Schur complements is expensive, we give
  a nearly-linear time algorithm that generates a coarsened graph on the relevant
  vertices that provably matches the Schur complement in expectation in each iteration.
  Our experiments involving prediction tasks on graphs demonstrate that computing
  embeddings on the coarsened graph, rather than the entire graph, leads to significant
  time savings without sacrificing accuracy.
