abstract: We study the bandit problem where the underlying expected reward is a Bounded
  Mean Oscillation (BMO) function. BMO functions are allowed to be discontinuous and
  unbounded, and are useful in modeling signals with singularities in the domain.
  We develop a toolset for BMO bandits, and provide an algorithm that can achieve
  poly-log $\delta$-regret â€“ a regret measured against an arm that is optimal after
  removing a $\delta$-sized portion of the arm space.
