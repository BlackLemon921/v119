abstract: In many real-world applications, we want to exploit multiple source datasets
  to build a model for a different but related target dataset. Despite the recent
  empirical success, most existing research has used ad-hoc methods to combine multiple
  sources, leading to a gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we develop
  a finite-sample generalization bound based on domain discrepancy and accordingly
  propose a theoretically justified optimization procedure. Our algorithm, Domain
  AggRegation Network (DARN), can automatically and dynamically balance between including
  more data to increase effective sample size and excluding irrelevant data to avoid
  negative effects during training. We find that DARN can significantly outperform
  the state-of-the-art alternatives on multiple real-world tasks, including digit/object
  recognition and sentiment analysis.
