abstract: Learning algorithms are often used in conjunction with expert decision makers
  in practical scenarios, however this fact is largely ignored when designing these
  algorithms. In this paper we explore how to learn predictors that can either predict
  or choose to defer the decision to a downstream expert. Given only samples of the
  expertâ€™s decisions, we give a procedure based on learning a classifier and a rejector
  and analyze it theoretically. Our approach is based on a novel reduction to cost
  sensitive learning where we give a consistent surrogate loss for cost sensitive
  learning that generalizes the cross entropy loss. We show the effectiveness of our
  approach on a variety of experimental tasks.
