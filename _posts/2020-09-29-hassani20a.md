abstract: We introduce a self-supervised approach for learning node and graph level
  representations by contrasting structural views of graphs. We show that unlike visual
  representation learning, increasing the number of views to more than two or contrasting
  multi-scale encodings do not improve performance, and the best performance is achieved
  by contrasting encodings from first-order neighbors and a graph diffusion. We achieve
  new state-of-the-art results in self-supervised learning on 8 out of 8 node and
  graph classification benchmarks under the linear evaluation protocol. For example,
  on Cora (node) and Reddit-Binary (graph) classification benchmarks, we achieve 86.8%
  and 84.5% accuracy, which are 5.5% and 2.4% relative improvements over previous
  state-of-the-art. When compared to supervised baselines, our approach outperforms
  them in 4 out of 8 benchmarks.
