abstract: Out-of-training-distribution (OOD) scenarios are a common challenge of learning
  agents at deployment, typically leading to arbitrary deductions and poorly-informed
  decisions. In principle, detection of and adaptation to OOD scenes can mitigate
  their adverse effects. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of current approaches
  to novel driving scenes and propose an epistemic uncertainty-aware planning method,
  called \emph{robust imitative planning} (RIP). Our method can detect and recover
  from some distribution shifts, reducing the overconfident and catastrophic extrapolations
  in OOD scenes. If the modelâ€™s uncertainty is too great to suggest a safe course
  of action, the model can instead query the expert driver for feedback, enabling
  sample-efficient online adaptation, a variant of our method we term \emph{adaptive
  robust imitative planning} (AdaRIP). Our methods outperform current state-of-the-art
  approaches in the nuScenes \emph{prediction} challenge, but since no benchmark evaluating
  OOD detection and adaption currently exists to assess \emph{control}, we introduce
  an autonomous car novel-scene benchmark, \texttt{CARNOVEL}, to evaluate the robustness
  of driving agents to a suite of tasks with distribution shifts, where our methods
  outperform all the baselines.
