abstract: This paper shows that deep learning (DL) representations of data produced
  by generative adversarial nets (GANs) are random vectors which fall within the class
  of so-called \emph{concentrated} random vectors. Further exploiting the fact that
  Gram matrices, of the type $G = X^\intercal X$ with $X=[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times
  n}$ and $x_i$ independent concentrated random vectors from a mixture model, behave
  asymptotically (as $n,p\to \infty$) as if the $x_i$ were drawn from a Gaussian mixture,
  suggests that DL representations of GAN-data can be fully described by their first
  two statistical moments for a wide range of standard classifiers. Our theoretical
  findings are validated by generating images with the BigGAN model and across different
  popular deep representation networks.
