abstract: Coagent policy gradient algorithms (CPGAs) are reinforcement learning algorithms
  for training a class of stochastic neural networks called coagent networks. In this
  work, we prove that CPGAs converge to locally optimal policies. Additionally, we
  extend prior theory to encompass asynchronous and recurrent coagent networks. These
  extensions facilitate the straightforward design and analysis of hierarchical reinforcement
  learning algorithms like the option-critic, and eliminate the need for complex derivations
  of customized learning rules for these algorithms.
