abstract: The performance of optimizers, particularly in deep learning, depends considerably
  on their chosen hyperparameter configuration. The efficacy of optimizers is often
  studied under near-optimal problem-specific hyperparameters, and finding these settings
  may be prohibitively costly for practitioners. In this work, we argue that a fair
  assessment of optimizers’ performance must take the computational cost of hyperparameter
  tuning into account, i.e., how easy it is to find good hyperparameter configurations
  using an automatic hyperparameter search. Evaluating a variety of optimizers on
  an extensive set of standard datasets and architectures, our results indicate that
  Adam is the most practical solution, particularly in low-budget scenarios.
