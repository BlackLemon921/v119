abstract: Estimating the score, i.e., the gradient of log density function, from a
  set of samples generated by an unknown distribution is a fundamental task in inference
  and learning of probabilistic models that involve flexible yet intractable densities.
  Kernel estimators based on Steinâ€™s methods or score matching have shown promise,
  however their theoretical properties and relationships have not been fully-understood.
  We provide a unifying view of these estimators under the framework of regularized
  nonparametric regression. It allows us to analyse existing estimators and construct
  new ones with desirable properties by choosing different hypothesis spaces and regularizers.
  A unified convergence analysis is provided for such estimators. Finally, we propose
  score estimators based on iterative regularization that enjoy computational benefits
  from curl-free kernels and fast convergence.
