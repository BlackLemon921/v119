abstract: Due to the wider availability of modern electronic health records, patient
  care data is often being stored in the form of time-series. Clustering such time-series
  data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients’ prognoses by identifying
  “similar” patients, and designing treatment guidelines that are tailored to homogeneous
  patient subgroups. In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering
  time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future
  outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities). To encourage
  each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes, the clustering is carried out
  by learning discrete representations that best describe the future outcome distribution
  based on novel loss functions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that
  our model achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks
  and identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information
  for clinical decision-making.
