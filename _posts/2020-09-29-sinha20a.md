abstract: Balancing performance and safety is crucial to deploying autonomous vehicles
  in multi-agent environments. In particular, autonomous racing is a domain that penalizes
  safe but conservative policies, highlighting the need for robust, adaptive strategies.
  Current approaches either make simplifying assumptions about other agents or lack
  robust mechanisms for online adaptation. This work makes algorithmic contributions
  to both challenges. First, to generate a realistic, diverse set of opponents, we
  develop a novel method for self-play based on replica-exchange Markov chain Monte
  Carlo. Second, we propose a distributionally robust bandit optimization procedure
  that adaptively adjusts risk aversion relative to uncertainty in beliefs about opponents’
  behaviors. We rigorously quantify the tradeoffs in performance and robustness when
  approximating these computations in real-time motion-planning, and we demonstrate
  our methods experimentally on autonomous vehicles that achieve scaled speeds comparable
  to Formula One racecars.
