abstract: The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in
  stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing
  flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions.
  However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted
  to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical
  structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension
  of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to
  hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed
  Tangent Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling
  ($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that
  explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive
  posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of
  our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows.
  Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction
  of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show
  that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data
  using hyperbolic latent variables.
