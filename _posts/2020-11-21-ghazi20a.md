abstract: 'Differential privacy (DP) is a formal notion for quantifying the privacy
  loss of algorithms. Algorithms in the central model of DP achieve high accuracy
  but make the strongest trust assumptions whereas those in the local DP model make
  the weakest trust assumptions but incur substantial accuracy loss. The shuffled
  DP model [Bittau et al 2017, Erlingsson et al 2019, Cheu et al 19] has recently
  emerged as a feasible middle ground between the central and local models, providing
  stronger trust assumptions than the former while promising higher accuracies than
  the latter. In this paper, we obtain practical communication-efficient algorithms
  in the shuffled DP model for two basic aggregation primitives used in machine learning:
  1) binary summation, and 2) histograms over a moderate number of buckets. Our algorithms
  achieve accuracy that is arbitrarily close to that of central DP algorithms with
  an expected communication per user essentially matching what is needed without any
  privacy constraints! We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by experimentally
  evaluating them and comparing their performance to several widely-used protocols
  such as Randomized Response [Warner 1965] and RAPPOR [Erlingsson et al. 2014].'
