abstract: Graph representation learning serves as the core of important prediction
  tasks, ranging from product recommendation to fraud detection. Real-life graphs
  usually have complex information in the local neighborhood, where each node is described
  by a rich set of features and connects to dozens or even hundreds of neighbors.
  Despite the success of neighborhood aggregation in graph neural networks, task-irrelevant
  information is mixed into nodesâ€™ neighborhood, making learned models suffer from
  sub-optimal generalization performance. In this paper, we present NeuralSparse,
  a supervised graph sparsification technique that improves generalization power by
  learning to remove potentially task-irrelevant edges from input graphs. Our method
  takes both structural and non-structural information as input, utilizes deep neural
  networks to parameterize sparsification processes, and optimizes the parameters
  by feedback signals from downstream tasks. Under the NeuralSparse framework, supervised
  graph sparsification could seamlessly connect with existing graph neural networks
  for more robust performance. Experimental results on both benchmark and private
  datasets show that NeuralSparse can yield up to 7.2% improvement in testing accuracy
  when working with existing graph neural networks on node classification tasks.
