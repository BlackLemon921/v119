abstract: Selective rationalization improves neural network interpretability by identifying
  a small subset of input features {—} the rationale {—} that best explains or supports
  the prediction. A typical rationalization criterion, i.e. maximum mutual information
  (MMI), finds the rationale that maximizes the prediction performance based only
  on the rationale. However, MMI can be problematic because it picks up spurious correlations
  between the input features and the output. Instead, we introduce a game-theoretic
  invariant rationalization criterion where the rationales are constrained to enable
  the same predictor to be optimal across different environments. We show both theoretically
  and empirically that the proposed rationales can rule out spurious correlations
  and generalize better to different test scenarios. The resulting explanations also
  align better with human judgments. Our implementations are publicly available at
  https://github.com/code-terminator/invariant_rationalization.
