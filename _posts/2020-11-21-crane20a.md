abstract: We present a novel communication-efficient Newton-type algorithm for finite-sum
  optimization over a distributed computing environment. Our method, named DINO, overcomes
  both theoretical and practical shortcomings of similar existing methods. Under minimal
  assumptions, we guarantee global sub-linear convergence of DINO to a first-order
  stationary point for general non-convex functions and arbitrary data distribution
  over the network. Furthermore, for functions satisfying Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL)
  inequality, we show that DINO enjoys a linear convergence rate. Our proposed algorithm
  is practically parameter free, in that it will converge regardless of the selected
  hyper-parameters, which are easy to tune. Additionally, its sub-problems are simple
  linear least-squares, for which efficient solvers exist, and numerical simulations
  demonstrate the efficiency of DINO as compared with similar alternatives.
