abstract: We study optimal covariate balance for causal inferences from observational
  data when rich covariates and complex relationships necessitate flexible modeling
  with neural networks. Standard approaches such as propensity weighting and matching/balancing
  fail in such settings due to miscalibrated propensity nets and inappropriate covariate
  representations, respectively. We propose a new method based on adversarial training
  of a weighting and a discriminator network that effectively addresses this methodological
  gap. This is demonstrated through new theoretical characterizations and empirical
  results on both synthetic and clinical data showing how causal analyses can be salvaged
  in such challenging settings.
