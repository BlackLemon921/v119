abstract: We consider the problem of learning the qualities w_1, ... , w_n of a collection
  of items by performing noisy comparisons among them. We assume there is a fixed
  “comparison graph” and every neighboring pair of items is compared k times. We will
  study the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where the probability that item i wins
  a comparison against j equals w_i/(w_i + w_j). We are interested in how the expected
  error in estimating the vector w = (w_1, ... , w_n) behaves in the regime when the
  number of comparisons k is large. Our contribution is the determination of the minimax
  rate up to a constant factor. We show that this rate is achieved by a simple algorithm
  based on weighted least squares, with weights determined from the empirical outcomes
  of the comparisons. This algorithm can be implemented in nearly linear time in the
  total number of comparisons.
