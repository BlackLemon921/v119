abstract: Machine learning algorithms are known to be susceptible to data poisoning
  attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to degrade performance
  of the resulting classifier. In this work, we present a unifying view of randomized
  smoothing over arbitrary functions, and we leverage this novel characterization
  to propose a new strategy for building classifiers that are pointwise-certifiably
  robust to general data poisoning attacks. As a specific instantiation, we utilize
  our framework to build linear classifiers that are robust to a strong variant of
  label flipping, where each test example is targeted independently. In other words,
  for each test point, our classifier includes a certification that its prediction
  would be the same had some number of training labels been changed adversarially.
  Randomized smoothing has previously been used to guarantee—with high probability—test-time
  robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to a classifier; we derive a
  variant which provides a deterministic, analytical bound, sidestepping the probabilistic
  certificates that traditionally result from the sampling subprocedure. Further,
  we obtain these certified bounds with minimal additional runtime complexity over
  standard classification and no assumptions on the train or test distributions. We
  generalize our results to the multi-class case, providing the first multi-class
  classification algorithm that is certifiably robust to label-flipping attacks.
