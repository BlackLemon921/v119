abstract: 'In this paper, we present a novel and principled approach to learn the
  optimal transport between two distributions, from samples. Guided by the optimal
  transport theory, we learn the optimal Kantorovich potential which induces the optimal
  transport map. This involves learning two convex functions, by solving a novel minimax
  optimization. Building upon recent advances in the field of input convex neural
  networks, we propose a new framework to estimate the optimal transport mapping as
  the gradient of a convex function that is trained via minimax optimization. Numerical
  experiments confirm the accuracy of the learned transport map. Our approach can
  be readily used to train a deep generative model. When trained between a simple
  distribution in the latent space and a target distribution, the learned optimal
  transport map acts as a deep generative model. Although scaling this to a large
  dataset is challenging, we demonstrate two important strengths over standard adversarial
  training: robustness and discontinuity. As we seek the optimal transport, the learned
  generative model provides the same mapping regardless of how we initialize the neural
  networks. Further, a gradient of a neural network can easily represent discontinuous
  mappings, unlike standard neural networks that are constrained to be continuous.
  This allows the learned transport map to match any target distribution with many
  discontinuous supports and achieve sharp boundaries.'
