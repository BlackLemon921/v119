abstract: Deep neural networks exhibit complex learning dynamics due to their non-convex
  loss landscapes. Second-order optimization methods facilitate learning dynamics
  by compensating for ill-conditioned curvature. In this work, we investigate how
  curvature correction modifies the learning dynamics in deep linear neural networks
  and provide analytical solutions. We derive a generalized conservation law that
  preserves the path of parameter dynamics from curvature correction, which shows
  that curvature correction only modifies the temporal profiles of dynamics along
  the path. We show that while curvature correction accelerates the convergence dynamics
  of the input-output map, it can also negatively affect the generalization performance.
  Our analysis also reveals an undesirable effect of curvature correction that compromises
  stability of parameters dynamics during learning, especially with block-diagonal
  approximation of natural gradient descent. We introduce fractional curvature correction
  that resolves this problem while retaining most of the acceleration benefits of
  full curvature correction.
