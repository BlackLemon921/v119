abstract: Lagrangian methods are widely used algorithms for constrained optimization
  problems, but their learning dynamics exhibit oscillations and overshoot which,
  when applied to safe reinforcement learning, leads to constraint-violating behavior
  during agent training. We address this shortcoming by proposing a novel Lagrange
  multiplier update method that utilizes derivatives of the constraint function. We
  take a controls perspective, wherein the traditional Lagrange multiplier update
  behaves as \emph{integral} control; our terms introduce \emph{proportional} and
  \emph{derivative} control, achieving favorable learning dynamics through damping
  and predictive measures. We apply our PID Lagrangian methods in deep RL, setting
  a new state of the art in Safety Gym, a safe RL benchmark. Lastly, we introduce
  a new method to ease controller tuning by providing invariance to the relative numerical
  scales of reward and cost. Our extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance
  and hyperparameter robustness, while our algorithms remain nearly as simple to derive
  and implement as the traditional Lagrangian approach.
