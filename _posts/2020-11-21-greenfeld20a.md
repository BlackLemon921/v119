abstract: 'We investigate the use of a non-parametric independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt
  Independence Criterion (HSIC), as a loss-function for learning robust regression
  and classification models. This loss-function encourages learning models where the
  distribution of the residuals between the label and the model prediction is statistically
  independent of the distribution of the instances themselves. This loss-function
  was first proposed by \citet{mooij2009regression} in the context of learning causal
  graphs. We adapt it to the task of learning for unsupervised covariate shift: learning
  on a source domain without access to any instances or labels from the unknown target
  domain, but with the assumption that $p(y|x)$ (the conditional probability of labels
  given instances) remains the same in the target domain. We show that the proposed
  loss is expected to give rise to models that generalize well on a class of target
  domains characterised by the complexity of their description within a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space. Experiments on unsupervised covariate shift tasks demonstrate
  that models learned with the proposed loss-function outperform models learned with
  standard loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results on a challenging cell-microscopy
  unsupervised covariate shift task.'
