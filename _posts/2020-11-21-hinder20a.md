abstract: The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution,
  which is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence machine
  learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many online learning
  schemes include drift detection to actively detect and react to observed changes.
  Yet, reliable drift detection constitutes a challenging problem in particular in
  the context of high dimensional data, varying drift characteristics, and the absence
  of a parametric model such as a classification scheme which reflects the drift.
  In this paper we present a novel concept drift detection method, Dynamic Adapting
  Window Independence Drift Detection (DAWIDD), which aims for non-parametric drift
  detection of diverse drift characteristics. For this purpose, we establish a mathematical
  equivalence of the presence of drift to the dependency of specific random variables
  in an according drift process. This allows us to rely on independence tests rather
  than parametric models or the classification loss, resulting in a fairly robust
  scheme to universally detect different types of drift, as it is also confirmed in
  experiments.
