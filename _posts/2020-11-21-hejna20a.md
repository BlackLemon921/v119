abstract: 'Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a fundamental
  problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that transferring learned information
  from a morphologically simpler agent can massively improve the sample efficiency
  of a more complex one. To this end, we propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies
  into two parts: an independently learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level
  policy. To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we
  contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent’s low-level
  to imitate a simpler agent’s low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level
  transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes
  learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly released navigation
  and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical
  transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies. Our code and videos can be found
