abstract: We provide a computational complexity analysis for the Sinkhorn algorithm
  that solves the entropic regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem
  between two measures of possibly different masses with at most $n$ components. We
  show that the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for finding an $\varepsilon$-approximate
  solution to the UOT problem is of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \varepsilon)$.
  To the best of our knowledge, this complexity is better than the best known complexity
  upper bound of the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the Optimal Transport (OT) problem,
  which is of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$. Our proof technique
  is based on the geometric convergence rate of the Sinkhorn updates to the optimal
  dual solution of the entropic regularized UOT problem and scaling properties of
  the primal solution. It is also different from the proof technique used to establish
  the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for approximating the OT problem since
  the UOT solution does not need to meet the marginal constraints of the measures.
