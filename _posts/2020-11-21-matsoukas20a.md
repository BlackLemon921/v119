abstract: 'Evidence suggests that networks trained on large datasets generalize well
  not solely because of the numerous training examples, but also class diversity which
  encourages learning of enriched features. This raises the question of whether this
  remains true when data is scarce - is there an advantage to learning with additional
  labels in low-data regimes? In this work, we consider a task that requires difficult-to-obtain
  expert annotations: tumor segmentation in mammography images. We show that, in low-data
  settings, performance can be improved by complementing the expert annotations with
  seemingly uninformative labels from non-expert annotators, turning the task into
  a multi-class problem. We reveal that these gains increase when less expert data
  is available, and uncover several interesting properties through further studies.
  We demonstrate our findings on CSAW-S, a new dataset that we introduce here, and
  confirm them on two public datasets.'
