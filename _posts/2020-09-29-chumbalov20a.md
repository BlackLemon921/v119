abstract: We consider the problem of finding a target object t using pairwise comparisons,
  by asking an oracle questions of the form “Which object from the pair (i,j) is more
  similar to t?”. Objects live in a space of latent features, from which the oracle
  generates noisy answers. First, we consider the non-blind setting where these features
  are accessible. We propose a new Bayesian comparison-based search algorithm with
  noisy answers; it has low computational complexity yet is efficient in the number
  of queries. We provide theoretical guarantees, deriving the form of the optimal
  query and proving almost sure convergence to the target t. Second, we consider the
  blind setting, where the object features are hidden from the search algorithm. In
  this setting, we combine our search method and a new distributional triplet embedding
  algorithm into one scalable learning framework called Learn2Search. We show that
  the query complexity of our approach on two real-world datasets is on par with the
  non-blind setting, which is not achievable using any of the current state-of-the-art
  embedding methods. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by conducting
  a movie actors search experiment with real users.
