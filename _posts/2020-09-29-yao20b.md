abstract: Sample selection approaches are popular in robust learning from noisy labels.
  However, how to properly control the selection process so that deep networks can
  benefit from the memorization effect is a hard problem. In this paper, motivated
  by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), we model this issue as a
  function approximation problem. Specifically, we design a domain-specific search
  space based on general patterns of the memorization effect and propose a novel Newton
  algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently. We further provide
  a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, which ensures a good approximation to critical
  points. Experiments are performed on both benchmark and real-world data sets. Results
  demonstrate that the proposed method is much better than the state-of-the-art noisy-label-learning
  approaches, and also much more efficient than existing AutoML algorithms.
