abstract: 'Dropout is a widely-used regularization technique, often required to obtain
  state-of-the-art for a number of architectures. This work demonstrates that dropout
  introduces two distinct but entangled regularization effects: an explicit effect
  (also studied in prior work) which occurs since dropout modifies the expected training
  objective, and, perhaps surprisingly, an additional implicit effect from the stochasticity
  in the dropout training update. This implicit regularization effect is analogous
  to the effect of stochasticity in small mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.
  We disentangle these two effects through controlled experiments. We then derive
  analytic simplifications which characterize each effect in terms of the derivatives
  of the model and the loss, for deep neural networks. We demonstrate these simplified,
  analytic regularizers accurately capture the important aspects of dropout, showing
  they faithfully replace dropout in practice.'
