abstract: This paper introduces the deep coordination graph (DCG) for collaborative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning. DCG strikes a flexible trade-off between representational
  capacity and generalization by factoring the joint value function of all agents
  according to a coordination graph into payoffs between pairs of agents. The value
  can be maximized by local message passing along the graph, which allows training
  of the value function end-to-end with Q-learning. Payoff functions are approximated
  with deep neural networks that employ parameter sharing and low-rank approximations
  to significantly improve sample efficiency. We show that DCG can solve predator-prey
  tasks that highlight the relative overgeneralization pathology, as well as challenging
  StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.
