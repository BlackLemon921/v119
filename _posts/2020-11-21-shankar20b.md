abstract: In this paper, we address the discovery of robotic options from demonstrations
  in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we present a framework to jointly learn
  low-level control policies and higher-level policies of how to use them from demonstrations
  of a robot performing various tasks. By representing options as continuous latent
  variables, we frame the problem of learning these options as latent variable inference.
  We then present a temporally causal variant of variational inference based on a
  temporal factorization of trajectory likelihoods, that allows us to infer options
  in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to learn
  such options across three robotic demonstration datasets, and provide our code.
