abstract: Datasets containing sensitive information are often sequentially analyzed
  by many algorithms and, accordingly, a fundamental question in differential privacy
  is concerned with how the overall privacy bound degrades under composition. To address
  this question, we introduce a family of analytical and sharp privacy bounds under
  composition using the Edgeworth expansion in the framework of the recently proposed
  $f$-differential privacy. In short, whereas the existing composition theorem, for
  example, relies on the central limit theorem, our new privacy bounds under composition
  gain improved tightness by leveraging the refined approximation accuracy of the
  Edgeworth expansion. Our approach is easy to implement and computationally efficient
  for any number of compositions. The superiority of these new bounds is confirmed
  by an asymptotic error analysis and an application to quantifying the overall privacy
  guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent used in training private deep neural
  networks.
