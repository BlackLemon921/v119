abstract: Extensive-form games (EFGs) are a common model of multi-agent interactions
  with imperfect information. State-of-the-art algorithms for solving these games
  typically perform full walks of the game tree that can prove prohibitively slow
  in large games. Alternatively, sampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo Counterfactual
  Regret Minimization walk one or more trajectories through the tree, touching only
  a fraction of the nodes on each iteration, at the expense of requiring more iterations
  to converge due to the variance of sampled values. In this paper, we extend recent
  work that uses baseline estimates to reduce this variance. We introduce a framework
  of baseline-corrected values in EFGs that generalizes the previous work. Within
  our framework, we propose new baseline functions that result in significantly reduced
  variance compared to existing techniques. We show that one particular choice of
  such a function — predictive baseline — is provably optimal under certain sampling
  schemes. This allows for efficient computation of zero-variance value estimates
  even along sampled trajectories.
