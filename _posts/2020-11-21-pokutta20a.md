abstract: It is well known that the standard greedy algorithm guarantees a worst-case
  approximation factor of $1-1/e$ when maximizing a monotone submodular function under
  a cardinality constraint. However, empirical studies show that its performance is
  substantially better in practice. This raises a natural question of explaining this
  improved performance of the greedy algorithm. In this work, we define sharpness
  for submodular functions as a candidate explanation for this phenomenon. We show
  that the greedy algorithm provably performs better as the sharpness of the submodular
  function increases. This improvement ties in closely with the faster convergence
  rates of first order methods for sharp functions in convex optimization.
