abstract: 'During the past five years the Bayesian deep learning community has developed
  increasingly accurate and efficient approximate inference procedures that allow
  for Bayesian inference in deep neural networks. However, despite this algorithmic
  progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency
  there are—as of early 2020—no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks
  in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding
  of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful
  MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields
  systematically worse predictions when compared to simpler methods including point
  estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance
  is improved significantly through the use of a “cold posterior” that overcounts
  evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are
  commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several
  hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through
  experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in
  Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of
  more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding
  the origin of cold posteriors.'
