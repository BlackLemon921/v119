abstract: At the heart of machine learning lies the question of generalizability of
  learned rules over previously unseen data. While over-parameterized models based
  on neural networks are now ubiquitous in machine learning applications, our understanding
  of their generalization capabilities is incomplete and this task is made harder
  by the non-convexity of the underlying learning problems. We provide a general framework
  to characterize the asymptotic generalization error for single-layer neural networks
  (i.e., generalized linear models) with arbitrary non-linearities, making it applicable
  to regression as well as classification problems. This framework enables analyzing
  the effect of (i) over-parameterization and non-linearity during modeling; (ii)
  choices of loss function, initialization, and regularizer during learning; and (iii)
  mismatch between training and test distributions. As examples, we analyze a few
  special cases, namely linear regression and logistic regression. We are also able
  to rigorously and analytically explain the \emph{double descent} phenomenon in generalized
  linear models.
