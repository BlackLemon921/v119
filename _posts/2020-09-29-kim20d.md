abstract: The recent development of flexible and scalable variational inference algorithms
  has popularized the use of deep probabilistic models in a wide range of applications.
  However, learning and reasoning about high-dimensional models with nondifferentiable
  densities are still a challenge. For such a model, inference algorithms struggle
  to estimate the gradients of variational objectives accurately, due to high variance
  in their estimates. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel variational inference
  algorithm for sequential data, which performs well even when the density from the
  model is not differentiable, for instance, due to the use of discrete random variables.
  The key feature of our algorithm is that it estimates future likelihoods at all
  time steps. The estimated future likelihoods form the core of our new low-variance
  gradient estimator. We formally analyze our gradient estimator from the perspective
  of variational objective, and show the effectiveness of our algorithm with synthetic
  and real datasets.
