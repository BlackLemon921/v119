abstract: In this paper, we consider multi-agent learning via online gradient descent
  in a class of games called $\lambda$-cocoercive games, a fairly broad class of games
  that admits many Nash equilibria and that properly includes unconstrained strongly
  monotone games. We characterize the finite-time last-iterate convergence rate for
  joint OGD learning on $\lambda$-cocoercive games; further, building on this result,
  we develop a fully adaptive OGD learning algorithm that does not require any knowledge
  of problem parameter (e.g. cocoercive constant $\lambda$) and show, via a novel
  double-stopping time technique, that this adaptive algorithm achieves same finite-time
  last-iterate convergence rate as non-adaptive counterpart. Subsequently, we extend
  OGD learning to the noisy gradient feedback case and establish last-iterate convergence
  results–first qualitative almost sure convergence, then quantitative finite-time
  convergence rates– all under non-decreasing step-sizes. To our knowledge, we provide
  the first set of results that fill in several gaps of the existing multi-agent online
  learning literature, where three aspects–finite-time convergence rates, non-decreasing
  step-sizes, and fully adaptive algorithms have been unexplored before.
