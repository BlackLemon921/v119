abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning to repair programs from diagnostic
  feedback (e.g., compiler error messages). Program repair is challenging for two
  reasons: First, it requires reasoning and tracking symbols across source code and
  diagnostic feedback. Second, labeled datasets available for program repair are relatively
  small. In this work, we propose novel solutions to these two challenges. First,
  we introduce a program-feedback graph, which connects symbols relevant to program
  repair in source code and diagnostic feedback, and then apply a graph neural network
  on top to model the reasoning process. Second, we present a self-supervised learning
  paradigm for program repair that leverages unlabeled programs available online to
  create a large amount of extra program repair examples, which we use to pre-train
  our models. We evaluate our proposed approach on two applications: correcting introductory
  programming assignments (DeepFix dataset) and correcting the outputs of program
  synthesis (SPoC dataset). Our final system, DrRepair, significantly outperforms
  prior work, achieving 68.2% full repair rate on DeepFix (+22.9% over the prior best),
  and 48.4% synthesis success rate on SPoC (+3.7% over the prior best).'
