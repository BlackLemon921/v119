abstract: Monte-Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) is the state-of-the-art
  algorithm for solving sequential games that are too large for full tree traversals.
  It works by using gradient estimates that can be computed via sampling. However,
  stochastic methods for sequential games have not been investigated extensively beyond
  MCCFR. In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret
  minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm,
  coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special
  case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly stronger theoretical
  guarantees on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our
  framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential
  games. We show extensive experiments on five games, where some variants of our methods
  outperform MCCFR.
