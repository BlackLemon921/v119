abstract: This work considers the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of tensors
  using proximally regularized sketched alternating least squares algorithms. First,
  it establishes a sublinear rate of convergence for proximally regularized sketched
  CPD algorithms under two natural conditions that are known to be satisfied by many
  popular forms of sketching. Second, it demonstrates that the iterative nature of
  CPD algorithms can be exploited algorithmically to choose more performant sketching
  rates. This is accomplished by introducing CPD-MWU, a proximally-regularized sketched
  alternating least squares algorithm that adaptively selects the sketching rate at
  each iteration. On both synthetic and real data we observe that for noisy tensors
  CPD-MWU produces decompositions of comparable accuracy to the standard CPD decomposition
  in less time, often half the time; for ill-conditioned tensors, given the same time
  budget, CPD-MWU produces decompositions with an order-of-magnitude lower relative
  error. For a representative real-world dataset CPD-MWU produces residual errors
  on average 20% lower than CPRAND-MIX and 44% lower than SPALS, two recent sketched
  CPD algorithms.
