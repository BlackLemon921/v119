abstract: Weak supervision is a popular method for building machine learning models
  without relying on ground truth annotations. Instead, it generates probabilistic
  training labels by estimating the accuracies of multiple noisy labeling sources
  (e.g., heuristics, crowd workers). Existing approaches use latent variable estimation
  to model the noisy sources, but these methods can be computationally expensive,
  scaling superlinearly in the data. In this work, we show that, for a class of latent
  variable models highly applicable to weak supervision, we can find a closed-form
  solution to model parameters, obviating the need for iterative solutions like stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD). We use this insight to build FlyingSquid, a weak supervision
  framework that runs orders of magnitude faster than previous weak supervision approaches
  and requires fewer assumptions. In particular, we prove bounds on generalization
  error without assuming that the latent variable model can exactly parameterize the
  underlying data distribution. Empirically, we validate FlyingSquid on benchmark
  weak supervision datasets and find that it achieves the same or higher quality compared
  to previous approaches without the need to tune an SGD procedure, recovers model
  parameters 170 times faster on average, and enables new video analysis and online
  learning applications.
