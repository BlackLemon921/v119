abstract: Efficient optimisation of black-box problems that comprise both continuous
  and categorical inputs is important, yet poses significant challenges. Current approaches,
  like one-hot encoding, severely increase the dimension of the search space, while
  separate modelling of category-specific data is sample-inefficient. Both frameworks
  are not scalable to practical applications involving multiple categorical variables,
  each with multiple possible values. We propose a new approach, Continuous and Categorical
  Bayesian Optimisation (CoCaBO), which combines the strengths of multi-armed bandits
  and Bayesian optimisation to select values for both categorical and continuous inputs.
  We model this mixed-type space using a Gaussian Process kernel, designed to allow
  sharing of information across multiple categorical variables; this allows CoCaBO
  to leverage all available data efficiently. We extend our method to the batch setting
  and propose an efficient selection procedure that dynamically balances exploration
  and exploitation whilst encouraging batch diversity. We demonstrate empirically
  that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world
  optimisation tasks with continuous and categorical inputs.
