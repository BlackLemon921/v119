abstract: 'In modern supervised learning, there are a large number of tasks, but many
  of them are associated with only a small amount of labelled data. These include
  data from medical image processing and robotic interaction. Even though each individual
  task cannot be meaningfully trained in isolation, one seeks to meta-learn across
  the tasks from past experiences by exploiting some similarities. We study a fundamental
  question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack
  of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn
  from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for
  such a graceful exchange to hold; there is little loss in sample complexity even
  when we only have access to small data tasks. To this end, we introduce a novel
  spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with
  the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$
  examples.'
