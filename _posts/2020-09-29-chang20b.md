abstract: This paper seeks to establish a framework for directing a society of simple,
  specialized, self-interested agents to solve what traditionally are posed as monolithic
  single-agent sequential decision problems. What makes it challenging to use a decentralized
  approach to collectively optimize a central objective is the difficulty in characterizing
  the equilibrium strategy profile of non-cooperative games. To overcome this challenge,
  we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each agent for which
  we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash
  equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives.
  The society functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process
  itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment
  state. We derive a class of decentralized reinforcement learning algorithms that
  are broadly applicable not only to standard reinforcement learning but also for
  selecting options in semi-MDPs and dynamically composing computation graphs. Lastly,
  we demonstrate the potential advantages of a societyâ€™s inherent modular structure
  for more efficient transfer learning.
