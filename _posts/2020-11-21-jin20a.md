abstract: Graph generation techniques are increasingly being adopted for drug discovery.
  Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building
  blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules.
  Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades significantly for larger molecules.
  In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs
  significantly larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our
  encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse
  fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents
  below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds
  one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the
  process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model
  on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model
  significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.
