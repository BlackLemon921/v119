abstract: Trained generative models have shown remarkable performance as priors for
  inverse problems in imaging â€“ for example, Generative Adversarial Network priors
  permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than sparsity priors.
  Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because
  of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this
  paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation
  error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such
  as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model,
  we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization
  that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically
  by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy
  than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack
  of representation error, invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than
  GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training
  set, including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance
  for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish
  theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible
  model.
