abstract: We evaluate a wide range of ImageNet models with five trained human labelers.
  In our year-long experiment, trained humans first annotated 40,000 images from the
  ImageNet and ImageNetV2 test sets with multi-class labels to enable a semantically
  coherent evaluation. Then we measured the classification accuracy of the five trained
  humans on the full task with 1,000 classes. Only the latest models from 2020 are
  on par with our best human labeler, and human accuracy on the 590 object classes
  is still 4% and 10% higher than the best model on ImageNet and ImageNetV2, respectively.
  Moreover, humans achieve the same accuracy on ImageNet and ImageNetV2, while all
  models see a consistent accuracy drop. Overall, our results show that there is still
  substantial room for improvement on ImageNet and direct accuracy comparisons between
  humans and machines may overstate machine performance.
