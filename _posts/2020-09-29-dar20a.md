abstract: We study the linear subspace fitting problem in the overparameterized setting,
  where the estimated subspace can perfectly interpolate the training examples. Our
  scope includes the least-squares solutions to subspace fitting tasks with varying
  levels of supervision in the training data (i.e., the proportion of input-output
  examples of the desired low-dimensional mapping) and orthonormality of the vectors
  defining the learned operator. This flexible family of problems connects standard,
  unsupervised subspace fitting that enforces strict orthonormality with a corresponding
  regression task that is fully supervised and does not constrain the linear operator
  structure. This class of problems is defined over a supervision-orthonormality plane,
  where each coordinate induces a problem instance with a unique pair of supervision
  level and softness of orthonormality constraints. We explore this plane and show
  that the generalization errors of the corresponding subspace fitting problems follow
  double descent trends as the settings become more supervised and less orthonormally
  constrained.
