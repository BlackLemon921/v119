abstract: Tensor factorization is a fundamental framework to analyze high-order interactions
  in data. Despite the success of the existing methods, the valuable temporal information
  are severely underused. The timestamps of the interactions are either ignored or
  discretized into crude steps. The recent work although formulates event-tensors
  to keep the timestamps in factorization and can capture mutual excitation effects
  among the interaction events, it overlooks another important type of temporal influence,
  inhibition. In addition, it uses a local window to exclude all the long-term dependencies.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-modulating nonparametric Bayesian
  factorization model. We use the latent factors to construct mutually governed, general
  random point processes, which can capture various short-term/long-term, excitation/inhibition
  effects, so as to encode the complex temporal dependencies into factor representations.
  In addition, our model couples with a latent Gaussian process to estimate and fuse
  nonlinear yet static relationships between the entities. For efficient inference,
  we derive a fully decomposed model evidence lower bound to dispense with the huge
  kernel matrix and costly summations inside the rate and log rate functions. We then
  develop an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm. We show the advantage of
  our method in four real-world applications.
