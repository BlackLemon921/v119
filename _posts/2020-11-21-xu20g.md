abstract: Label distribution covers a certain number of labels, representing the degree
  to which each label describes the instance. When dealing with label ambiguity, label
  distribution could describe the supervised information in a fine-grained way. Unfortunately,
  many training sets only contain simple logical labels rather than label distributions
  due to the difficulty of obtaining label distributions directly. To solve this problem,
  we consider the label distributions as the latent vectors and infer them from the
  logical labels in the training datasets by using variational inference. After that,
  we induce a predictive model to train the label distribution data by employing the
  multi-output regression technique. The recovery experiment on thirteen real-world
  LDL datasets and the predictive experiment on ten multi-label learning datasets
  validate the advantage of our approach over the state-of-the-art approaches.
