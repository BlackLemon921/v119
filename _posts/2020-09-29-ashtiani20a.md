abstract: We formally study the problem of classification under adversarial perturbations
  from a learnerâ€™s perspective as well as a third-party who aims at certifying the
  robustness of a given black-box classifier. We analyze a PAC-type framework of semi-supervised
  learning and identify possibility and impossibility results for proper learning
  of VC-classes in this setting. We further introduce a new setting of black-box certification
  under limited query budget, and analyze this for various classes of predictors and
  perturbation. We also consider the viewpoint of a black-box adversary that aims
  at finding adversarial examples, showing that the existence of an adversary with
  polynomial query complexity can imply the existence of a sample efficient robust
  learner.
