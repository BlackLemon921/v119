abstract: A framework based on iterative coordinate minimization (CM) is developed
  for stochastic convex optimization. Given that exact coordinate minimization is
  impossible due to the unknown stochastic nature of the objective function, the crux
  of the proposed optimization algorithm is an optimal control of the minimization
  precision in each iteration. We establish the optimal precision control and the
  resulting order-optimal regret performance for strongly convex and separably nonsmooth
  functions. An interesting finding is that the optimal progression of precision across
  iterations is independent of the low-dimension CM routine employed, suggesting a
  general framework for extending low-dimensional optimization routines to high-dimensional
  problems. The proposed algorithm is amenable to online implementation and inherits
  the scalability and parallelizability properties of CM for large-scale optimization.
  Requiring only a sublinear order of message exchanges, it also lends itself well
  to distributed computing as compared with the alternative approach of coordinate
  gradient descent.
