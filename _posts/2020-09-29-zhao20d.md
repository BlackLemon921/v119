abstract: The instability in GANsâ€™ training has been a long-standing problem despite
  remarkable research efforts. We identify that instability issues stem from difficulties
  of performing feature matching with mini-batch statistics, due to a fragile balance
  between the fixed target distribution and the progressively generated distribution.
  In this work, we propose feature quantizatoin (FQ) for the discriminator, to embed
  both true and fake data samples into a shared discrete space. The quantized values
  of FQ are constructed as an evolving dictionary, which is consistent with feature
  statistics of the recent distribution history. Hence, FQ implicitly enables robust
  feature matching in a compact space. Our method can be easily plugged into existing
  GAN models, with little computational overhead in training. Extensive experimental
  results show that the proposed FQ-GAN can improve the FID scores of baseline methods
  by a large margin on a variety of tasks, including three representative GAN models
  on 10 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.
