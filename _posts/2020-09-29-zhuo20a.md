abstract: Retrieving relevant targets from an extremely large target set under computational
  limits is a common challenge for information retrieval and recommendation systems.
  Tree models, which formulate targets as leaves of a tree with trainable node-wise
  scorers, have attracted a lot of interests in tackling this challenge due to their
  logarithmic computational complexity in both training and testing. Tree-based deep
  models (TDMs) and probabilistic label trees (PLTs) are two representative kinds
  of them. Though achieving many practical successes, existing tree models suffer
  from the training-testing discrepancy, where the retrieval performance deterioration
  caused by beam search in testing is not considered in training. This leads to an
  intrinsic gap between the most relevant targets and those retrieved by beam search
  with even the optimally trained node-wise scorers. We take a first step towards
  understanding and analyzing this problem theoretically, and develop the concept
  of Bayes optimality under beam search and calibration under beam search as general
  analyzing tools for this purpose. Moreover, to eliminate the discrepancy, we propose
  a novel algorithm for learning optimal tree models under beam search. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real data verify the rationality of our theoretical analysis
  and demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.
