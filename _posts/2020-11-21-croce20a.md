abstract: The evaluation of robustness against adversarial manipulation of neural
  networks-based classifiers is mainly tested with empirical attacks as methods for
  the exact computation, even when available, do not scale to large networks. We propose
  in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt the $l_p$-norms for $p \in
  \{1,2,\infty\}$ aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the
  class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high
  quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the
  robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run). It performs better or similar
  to state-of-the-art attacks which are partially specialized to one $l_p$-norm, and
  is robust to the phenomenon of gradient obfuscation.
