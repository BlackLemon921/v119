abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised neural system, named Position-wise
  Orthogonal Knowledge-Enhanced Disambiguator (PoKED), which effectively supports
  attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for word sense disambiguation (WSD)
  tasks. The proposed PoKED system incorporates position-wise encoding into an orthogonal
  framework and applies a knowledge-based attentive neural model to solve the WSD
  problem. Our proposed unsupervised language model is trained over unlabeled corpora.
  Then the pre-trained language model is used to abstract the surrounding context
  of polysemous words in labeled corpora into context embeddings. We further use the
  semantic relations in the WordNet, by extracting semantic level inter-word connections
  from each document-sentence pair in the WSD dataset. Our experimental results from
  standard benchmarks show that our proposed system, PoKED, can achieve competitive
  performance compared with state-of-the-art knowledge-based WSD systems.
