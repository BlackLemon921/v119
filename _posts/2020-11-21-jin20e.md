abstract: 'Minimax optimization has found extensive applications in modern machine
  learning, in settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adversarial
  training and multi-agent reinforcement learning. As most of these applications involve
  continuous nonconvex-nonconcave formulations, a very basic question arises—“what
  is a proper definition of local optima?” Most previous work answers this question
  using classical notions of equilibria from simultaneous games, where the min-player
  and the max-player act simultaneously. In contrast, most applications in machine
  learning, including GANs and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games,
  where the order of which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general
  not equal to maximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems). The
  main contribution of this paper is to propose a proper mathematical definition of
  local optimality for this sequential setting—local minimax, as well as to present
  its properties and existence results. Finally, we establish a strong connection
  to a basic local search algorithm—gradient descent ascent (GDA): under mild conditions,
  all stable limit points of GDA are exactly local minimax points up to some degenerate
  points.'
