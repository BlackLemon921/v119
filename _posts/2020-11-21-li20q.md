abstract: We give the first input-sparsity time algorithms for the rank-$k$ low rank
  approximation problem in every Schatten norm. Specifically, for a given $n\times
  n$ matrix $A$, our algorithm computes $Y,Z\in \R^{n\times k}$, which, with high
  probability, satisfy $\|A-YZ^T\|_p \leq (1+\eps)\|A-A_k\|_p$, where $\|M\|_p = \left
  (\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(M)^p \right )^{1/p}$ is the Schatten $p$-norm of a matrix
  $M$ with singular values $\sigma_1(M), \ldots, \sigma_n(M)$, and where $A_k$ is
  the best rank-$k$ approximation to $A$. Our algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A)
  + n^{\alpha_p}\poly(k/\eps))$, where $\alpha_p = 1$ for $p\in [1,2)$ and $\alpha_p
  = 1 + (\omega-1)(1-2/p)$ for $p>2$ and $\omega \approx 2.374$ is the exponent of
  matrix multiplication. For the important case of $p = 1$, which corresponds to the
  more “robust” nuclear norm, we obtain $\tilde{O}(\nnz(A) + n \cdot \poly(k/\epsilon))$
  time, which was previously only known for the Frobenius norm $(p = 2)$. Moreover,
  since $\alpha_p < \omega$ for every $p$, our algorithm has a better dependence on
  $n$ than that in the singular value decomposition for every $p$. Crucial to our
  analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction for Ky-Fan $p$-norms.
