abstract: We present a new method for separating a mixed audio sequence, in which
  multiple voices speak simultaneously. The new method employs gated neural networks
  that are trained to separate the voices at multiple processing steps, while maintaining
  the speaker in each output channel fixed. A different model is trained for every
  number of possible speakers, and the model with the largest number of speakers is
  employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample. Our method greatly
  outperforms the current state of the art, which, as we show, is not competitive
  for more than two speakers.
