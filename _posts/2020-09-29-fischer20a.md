abstract: Planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) inherently
  gathers the information necessary to act optimally under uncertainties. The framework
  can be extended to model pure information gathering tasks by considering belief-based
  rewards. This allows us to use reward shaping to guide POMDP planning to informative
  beliefs by using a weighted combination of the original reward and the expected
  information gain as the objective. In this work we propose a novel online algorithm,
  Information Particle Filter Tree (IPFT), to solve problems with belief-dependent
  rewards on continuous domains. It simulates particle-based belief trajectories in
  a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach to construct a search tree in the belief
  space. The evaluation shows that the consideration of information gain greatly improves
  the performance in problems where information gathering is an essential part of
  the optimal policy.
