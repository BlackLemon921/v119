abstract: Key problems arising in web applications (with millions of users and thousands
  of items) can be formulated as linear programs involving billions to trillions of
  decision variables and constraints. Despite the appeal of linear program (LP) formulations,
  solving problems at these scales appear to be well beyond the capabilities of existing
  LP solvers. Often ad-hoc decomposition rules are used to approximately solve these
  LPs, which have limited optimality guarantees and may lead to sub-optimal performance
  in practice. In this work, we propose a distributed solver that solves a perturbation
  of the LP problems at scale via a gradient-based algorithm on the smooth dual of
  the perturbed LP. The main workhorses of our algorithm are distributed matrix-vector
  multiplications (with load balancing) and efficient projection operations on distributed
  machines. Experiments on real-world data show that our proposed LP solver, ECLIPSE,
  can solve problems with $10^{12}$ decision variables â€“ well beyond the capabilities
  of current solvers.
