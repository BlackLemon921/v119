abstract: Collaborative machine learning (ML) is an appealing paradigm to build high-quality
  ML models by training on the aggregated data from many parties. However, these parties
  are only willing to share their data when given enough incentives, such as a guaranteed
  fair reward based on their contributions. This motivates the need for measuring
  a party’s contribution and designing an incentive-aware reward scheme accordingly.
  This paper proposes to value a party’s reward based on Shapley value and information
  gain on model parameters given its data. Subsequently, we give each party a model
  as a reward. To formally incentivize the collaboration, we define some desirable
  properties (e.g., fairness and stability) which are inspired by cooperative game
  theory but adapted for our model reward that is uniquely freely replicable. Then,
  we propose a novel model reward scheme to satisfy fairness and trade off between
  the desirable properties via an adjustable parameter. The value of each party’s
  model reward determined by our scheme is attained by injecting Gaussian noise to
  the aggregated training data with an optimized noise variance. We empirically demonstrate
  interesting properties of our scheme and evaluate its performance using synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
