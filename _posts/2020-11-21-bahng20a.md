abstract: Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting
  data from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on in-distribution
  learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has not been able to tell
  if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g.,
  using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles), resulting in biased models that fail
  to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation
  problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling,
  which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images
  of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases
  in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased
  representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that
  are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much
  easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across a variety of synthetic and real-world
  biases; our experiments show that the method discourages models from taking bias
  shortcuts, resulting in improved generalisation. Source code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/rebias.
