abstract: We present three new algorithms for constructing differentially private
  synthetic data—a sanitized version of a sensitive dataset that approximately preserves
  the answers to a large collection of statistical queries. All three algorithms are
  \emph{oracle-efficient} in the sense that they are computationally efficient when
  given access to an optimization oracle. Such an oracle can be implemented using
  many existing (non-private) optimization tools such as sophisticated integer program
  solvers. While the accuracy of the synthetic data is contingent on the oracle’s
  optimization performance, the algorithms satisfy differential privacy even in the
  worst case. For all three algorithms, we provide theoretical guarantees for both
  accuracy and privacy. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our methods
  scale well with both the dimensionality of the data and the number of queries. Compared
  to the state-of-the-art method High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (McKenna et al. VLDB
  2018), our algorithms provide better accuracy in the large workload and high privacy
  regime (corresponding to low privacy loss $\eps$).
