abstract: 'Good data stewardship requires removal of data at the request of the data’s
  owner. This raises the question if and how a trained machine-learning model, which
  implicitly stores information about its training data, should be affected by such
  a removal request. Is it possible to “remove” data from a machine-learning model?
  We study this problem by defining certified removal: a very strong theoretical guarantee
  that a model from which data is removed cannot be distinguished from a model that
  never observed the data to begin with. We develop a certified-removal mechanism
  for linear classifiers and empirically study learning settings in which this mechanism
  is practical.'
