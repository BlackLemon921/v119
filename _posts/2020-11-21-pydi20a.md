abstract: The accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms deteriorates severely
  on adversarially manipulated test data. Optimal adversarial risk quantifies the
  best error rate of any classifier in the presence of adversaries, and optimal adversarial
  classifiers are sought that minimize adversarial risk. In this paper, we investigate
  the optimal adversarial risk and optimal adversarial classifiers from an optimal
  transport perspective. We present a new and simple approach to show that the optimal
  adversarial risk for binary classification with 0 âˆ’ 1 loss function is completely
  characterized by an optimal transport cost between the probability distributions
  of the two classes, for a suitably defined cost function. We propose a novel coupling
  strategy that achieves the optimal transport cost for several univariate distributions
  like Gaussian, uniform and triangular. Using the optimal couplings, we obtain the
  optimal adversarial classifiers in these settings and show how they differ from
  optimal classifiers in the absence of adversaries. Based on our analysis, we evaluate
  algorithm-independent fundamental limits on adversarial risk for CIFAR-10, MNIST,
  Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets, and Gaussian mixtures based on them.
