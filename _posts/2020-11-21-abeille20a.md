abstract: We study the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the linear quadratic regulator
  (LQR) setting. Inspired by the extended value iteration algorithm used in optimistic
  algorithms for finite MDPs, we propose to relax the optimistic optimization of \ofulq
  and cast it into a constrained \emph{extended} LQR problem, where an additional
  control variable implicitly selects the system dynamics within a confidence interval.
  We then move to the corresponding Lagrangian formulation for which we prove strong
  duality. As a result, we show that an $\epsilon$-optimistic controller can be computed
  efficiently by solving at most $O\big(\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$ Riccati equations.
  Finally, we prove that relaxing the original \ofu problem does not impact the learning
  performance, thus recovering the $\wt O(\sqrt{T})$ regret of \ofulq. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first computationally efficient confidence-based algorithm
  for LQR with worst-case optimal regret guarantees.
