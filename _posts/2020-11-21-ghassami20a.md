abstract: The main approach to defining equivalence among acyclic directed causal
  graphical models is based on the conditional independence relationships in the distributions
  that the causal models can generate, in terms of the Markov equivalence. However,
  it is known that when cycles are allowed in the causal structure, conditional independence
  may not be a suitable notion for equivalence of two structures, as it does not reflect
  all the information in the distribution that is useful for identification of the
  underlying structure. In this paper, we present a general, unified notion of equivalence
  for linear Gaussian causal directed graphical models, whether they are cyclic or
  acyclic. In our proposed definition of equivalence, two structures are equivalent
  if they can generate the same set of data distributions. We also propose a weaker
  notion of equivalence called quasi-equivalence, which we show is the extent of identifiability
  from observational data. We propose analytic as well as graphical methods for characterizing
  the equivalence of two structures. Additionally, we propose a score-based method
  for learning the structure from observational data, which successfully deals with
  both acyclic and cyclic structures.
