abstract: Many applications require sparse neural networks due to space or inference
  time restrictions. There is a large body of work on training dense networks to yield
  sparse networks for inference, but this limits the size of the largest trainable
  sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this paper we introduce
  a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed
  computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to
  existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our method updates the topology of the
  sparse network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient
  calculations. We show that this approach requires fewer floating-point operations
  (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate
  state-of-the-art sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets,
  including ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally,
  we provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the optimization
  can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains static.
