abstract: 'Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is one of the most popular frameworks
  to tackle continuous Markov decision process tasks. With its fundamental theory
  and tractable optimal policy, LQR has been revisited and analyzed in recent years,
  in terms of reinforcement learning scenarios such as the model-free or model-based
  setting. In this paper, we introduce the Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) for
  LQR, a method capable of deriving a structured linear policy. Such a structured
  policy with (block) sparsity or low-rank can have significant advantages over the
  standard LQR policy: more interpretable, memory-efficient, and well-suited for the
  distributed setting. In order to derive such a policy, we first cast a regularized
  LQR problem when the model is known. Then, our Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI)
  algorithm, which takes a policy evaluation step and a policy improvement step in
  an iterative manner, can solve this regularized LQR efficiently. We further extend
  the S-PI algorithm to the model-free setting where a smoothing procedure is adopted
  to estimate the gradient. In both the known-model and model-free setting, we prove
  convergence analysis under the proper choice of parameters. Finally, the experiments
  demonstrate the advantages of S-PI in terms of balancing the LQR performance and
  level of structure by varying the weight parameter.'
