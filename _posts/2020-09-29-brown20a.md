abstract: Bayesian reward learning from demonstrations enables rigorous safety and
  uncertainty analysis when performing imitation learning. However, Bayesian reward
  learning methods are typically computationally intractable for complex control problems.
  We propose Bayesian Reward Extrapolation (Bayesian REX), a highly efficient Bayesian
  reward learning algorithm that scales to high-dimensional imitation learning problems
  by pre-training a low-dimensional feature encoding via self-supervised tasks and
  then leveraging preferences over demonstrations to perform fast Bayesian inference.
  Bayesian REX can learn to play Atari games from demonstrations, without access to
  the game score and can generate 100,000 samples from the posterior over reward functions
  in only 5 minutes on a personal laptop. Bayesian REX also results in imitation learning
  performance that is competitive with or better than state-of-the-art methods that
  only learn point estimates of the reward function. Finally, Bayesian REX enables
  efficient high-confidence policy evaluation without having access to samples of
  the reward function. These high-confidence performance bounds can be used to rank
  the performance and risk of a variety of evaluation policies and provide a way to
  detect reward hacking behaviors.
