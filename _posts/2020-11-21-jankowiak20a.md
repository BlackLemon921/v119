abstract: The combination of inducing point methods with stochastic variational inference
  has enabled approximate Gaussian Process (GP) inference on large datasets. Unfortunately,
  the resulting predictive distributions often exhibit substantially underestimated
  uncertainties. Notably, in the regression case the predictive variance is typically
  dominated by observation noise, yielding uncertainty estimates that make little
  use of the input-dependent function uncertainty that makes GP priors attractive.
  In this work we propose two simple methods for scalable GP regression that address
  this issue and thus yield substantially improved predictive uncertainties. The first
  applies variational inference to FITC (Fully Independent Training Conditional; Snelson
  et. al. 2006). The second bypasses posterior approximations and instead directly
  targets the posterior predictive distribution. In an extensive empirical comparison
  with a number of alternative methods for scalable GP regression, we find that the
  resulting predictive distributions exhibit significantly better calibrated uncertainties
  and higher log likelihoodsâ€“often by as much as half a nat per datapoint.
