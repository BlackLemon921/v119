abstract: Modern deep learning models employ considerably more parameters than required
  to fit the training data. Whereas conventional statistical wisdom suggests such
  models should drastically overfit, in practice these models generalize remarkably
  well. An emerging paradigm for describing this unexpected behavior is in terms of
  a \emph{double descent} curve, in which increasing a modelâ€™s capacity causes its
  test error to first decrease, then increase to a maximum near the interpolation
  threshold, and then decrease again in the overparameterized regime. Recent efforts
  to explain this phenomenon theoretically have focused on simple settings, such as
  linear regression or kernel regression with unstructured random features, which
  we argue are too coarse to reveal important nuances of actual neural networks. We
  provide a precise high-dimensional asymptotic analysis of generalization under kernel
  regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel, which characterizes the behavior of wide
  neural networks optimized with gradient descent. Our results reveal that the test
  error has nonmonotonic behavior deep in the overparameterized regime and can even
  exhibit additional peaks and descents when the number of parameters scales quadratically
  with the dataset size.
