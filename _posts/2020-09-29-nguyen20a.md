abstract: We develop an extension of the knockoff inference procedure, introduced
  by Barber & Candes (2015). This new method, called Aggregation of Multiple Knockoffs
  (AKO), addresses the instability inherent to the random nature of knockoff-based
  inference. Specifically, AKO improves both the stability and power compared with
  the original knockoff algorithm while still maintaining guarantees for false discovery
  rate control. We provide a new inference procedure, prove its core properties, and
  demonstrate its benefits in a set of experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
