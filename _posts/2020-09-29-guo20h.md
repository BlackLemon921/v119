abstract: Quantization based techniques are the current state-of-the-art for scaling
  maximum inner product search to massive databases. Traditional approaches to quantization
  aim to minimize the reconstruction error of the database points. Based on the observation
  that for a given query, the database points that have the largest inner products
  are more relevant, we develop a family of anisotropic quantization loss functions.
  Under natural statistical assumptions, we show that quantization with these loss
  functions leads to a new variant of vector quantization that more greatly penalizes
  the parallel component of a datapointâ€™s residual relative to its orthogonal component.
  The proposed approach, whose implementation is open-source, achieves state-of-the-art
  results on the public benchmarks available at ann-benchmarks.com.
