abstract: Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, so far, such methods have been mostly analyzed from
  an optimization perspective, without addressing the problem of exploration, or by
  making strong assumptions on the interaction with the environment. In this paper
  we consider model-based RL in the tabular finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown
  transitions and bandit feedback. For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust
  region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2
  A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{
  S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result
  matches previous bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions.
  To the best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds
  obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit
  feedback.
