abstract: Designing video prediction models that account for the inherent uncertainty
  of the future is challenging. Most works in the literature are based on stochastic
  image-autoregressive recurrent networks, which raises several performance and applicability
  issues. An alternative is to use fully latent temporal models which untie frame
  synthesis and temporal dynamics. However, no such model for stochastic video prediction
  has been proposed in the literature yet, due to design and training difficulties.
  In this paper, we overcome these difficulties by introducing a novel stochastic
  temporal model whose dynamics are governed in a latent space by a residual update
  rule. This first-order scheme is motivated by discretization schemes of differential
  equations. It naturally models video dynamics as it allows our simpler, more interpretable,
  latent model to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.
