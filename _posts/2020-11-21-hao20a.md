abstract: The best-known and most commonly used technique for distribution-property
  estimation uses a plug-in estimator, with empirical frequency replacing the underlying
  distribution. We present novel linear-time-computable estimators that significantly
  “amplify” the effective amount of data available. For a large variety of distribution
  properties including four of the most popular ones and for every underlying distribution,
  they achieve the accuracy that the empirical-frequency plug-in estimators would
  attain using a logarithmic-factor more samples. Specifically, for Shannon entropy
  and a broad class of Lipschitz properties including the $L_1$ distance to a fixed
  distribution, the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the accuracy attained
  by the empirical estimators with $n\log n$ samples. For support-size and coverage,
  the new estimators use $n$ samples to achieve the performance of empirical frequency
  with sample size $n$ times the logarithm of the property value. Significantly strengthening
  the traditional min-max formulation, these results hold not only for the worst distributions,
  but for each and every underlying distribution. Furthermore, the logarithmic amplification
  factors are optimal. Experiments on a wide variety of distributions show that the
  new estimators outperform the previous state-of-the-art estimators designed for
  each specific property.
