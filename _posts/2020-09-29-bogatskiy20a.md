abstract: We present a neural network architecture that is fully equivariant with
  respect to transformations under the Lorentz group, a fundamental symmetry of space
  and time in physics. The architecture is based on the theory of the finite-dimensional
  representations of the Lorentz group and the equivariant nonlinearity involves the
  tensor product. For classification tasks in particle physics, we show that such
  an equivariant architecture leads to drastically simpler models that have relatively
  few learnable parameters and are much more physically interpretable than leading
  approaches that use CNNs and point cloud approaches. The performance of the network
  is tested on a public classification dataset [https://zenodo.org/record/2603256]
  for tagging top quark decays given energy-momenta of jet constituents produced in
  proton-proton collisions.
