abstract: 'We are interested in how to design reinforcement learning agents that provably
  reduce the sample complexity for learning new tasks by transferring knowledge from
  previously-solved ones. The availability of solutions to related problems poses
  a fundamental trade-off: whether to seek policies that are expected to immediately
  achieve high (yet sub-optimal) performance in the new task or whether to seek information
  to quickly identify an optimal solution, potentially at the cost of poor initial
  behaviour. In this work, we focus on the second objective when the agent has access
  to a generative model of state-action pairs. First, given a set of solved tasks
  containing an approximation of the target one, we design an algorithm that quickly
  identifies an accurate solution by seeking the state-action pairs that are most
  informative for this purpose. We derive PAC bounds on its sample complexity which
  clearly demonstrate the benefits of using this kind of prior knowledge. Then, we
  show how to learn these approximate tasks sequentially by reducing our transfer
  setting to a hidden Markov model and employing spectral methods to recover its parameters.
  Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical findings in simple simulated domains.'
