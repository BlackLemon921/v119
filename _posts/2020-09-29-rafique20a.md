abstract: We propose a novel type of hybrid model for multi-class classification,
  which utilizes competing linear models to collaborate with an existing black-box
  model, promoting transparency in the decision-making process. Our proposed hybrid
  model, Model-Agnostic Linear Competitors (MALC), brings together the interpretable
  power of linear models and the good predictive performance of the state-of-the-art
  black-box models. We formulate the training of a MALC model as a convex optimization
  problem, optimizing the predictive accuracy and transparency (defined as the percentage
  of data captured by the linear models) in the objective function. Experiments show
  that MALC offers more model flexibility for users to balance transparency and accuracy,
  in contrast to the currently available choice of either a pure black-box model or
  a pure interpretable model. The human evaluation also shows that more users are
  likely to choose MALC for this model flexibility compared with interpretable models
  and black-box models.
