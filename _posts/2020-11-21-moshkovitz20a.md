abstract: Many clustering algorithms lead to cluster assignments that are hard to
  explain, partially because they depend on all the features of the data in a complicated
  way. To improve interpretability, we consider using a small decision tree to partition
  a data set into clusters, so that clusters can be characterized in a straightforward
  manner. We study this problem from a theoretical viewpoint, measuring cluster quality
  by the k-means and k-medians objectives. In terms of negative results, we show that
  popular top-down decision tree algorithms may lead to clusterings with arbitrarily
  large cost, and any clustering based on a tree with k leaves must incur an Omega(log
  k) approximation factor compared to the optimal clustering. On the positive side,
  for two means/medians, we show that a single threshold cut can achieve a constant
  factor approximation, and we give nearly-matching lower bounds; for general k >
  2, we design an efficient algorithm that leads to an O(k) approximation to the optimal
  k-medians and an O(k^2) approximation to the optimal k-means. Prior to our work,
  no algorithms were known with provable guarantees independent of dimension and input
  size.
