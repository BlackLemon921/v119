abstract: The success of adversarial formulations in machine learning has brought
  renewed motivation for smooth games. In this work, we focus on the class of stochastic
  Hamiltonian methods and provide the first convergence guarantees for certain classes
  of stochastic smooth games. We propose a novel unbiased estimator for the stochastic
  Hamiltonian gradient descent (SHGD) and highlight its benefits. Using tools from
  the optimization literature we show that SHGD converges linearly to the neighbourhood
  of a stationary point. To guarantee convergence to the exact solution, we analyze
  SHGD with a decreasing step-size and we also present the first stochastic variance
  reduced Hamiltonian method. Our results provide the first global non-asymptotic
  last-iterate convergence guarantees for the class of stochastic unconstrained bilinear
  games and for the more general class of stochastic games that satisfy a â€œsufficiently
  bilinear" condition, notably including some non-convex non-concave problems. We
  supplement our analysis with experiments on stochastic bilinear and sufficiently
  bilinear games, where our theory is shown to be tight, and on simple adversarial
  machine learning formulations.
