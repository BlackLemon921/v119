abstract: We investigate the generalisation performance of Distributed Gradient Descent
  with implicit regularisation and random features in the homogenous setting where
  a network of agents are given data sampled independently from the same unknown distribution.
  Along with reducing the memory footprint, random features are particularly convenient
  in this setting as they provide a common parameterisation across agents that allows
  to overcome previous difficulties in implementing decentralised kernel regression.
  Under standard source and capacity assumptions, we establish high probability bounds
  on the predictive performance for each agent as a function of the step size, number
  of iterations, inverse spectral gap of the communication matrix and number of random
  features. By tuning these parameters, we obtain statistical rates that are minimax
  optimal with respect to the total number of samples in the network. The algorithm
  provides a linear improvement over single-machine gradient descent in memory cost
  and, when agents hold enough data with respect to the network size and inverse spectral
  gap, a linear speed up in computational run-time for any network topology. We present
  simulations that show how the number of random features, iterations and samples
  impact predictive performance.
