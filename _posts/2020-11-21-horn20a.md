abstract: Despite the eminent successes of deep neural networks, many architectures
  are often hard to transfer to irregularly-sampled and asynchronous time series that
  commonly occur in real-world datasets, especially in healthcare applications. This
  paper proposes a novel approach for classifying irregularly-sampled time series
  with unaligned measurements, focusing on high scalability and data efficiency. Our
  method SeFT (Set Functions for Time Series) is based on recent advances in differentiable
  set function learning, extremely parallelizable with a beneficial memory footprint,
  thus scaling well to large datasets of long time series and online monitoring scenarios.
  Furthermore, our approach permits quantifying per-observation contributions to the
  classification outcome. We extensively compare our method with existing algorithms
  on multiple healthcare time series datasets and demonstrate that it performs competitively
  whilst significantly reducing runtime.
