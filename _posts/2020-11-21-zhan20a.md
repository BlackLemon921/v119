abstract: 'We study the problem of controllable generation of long-term sequential
  behaviors, where the goal is to calibrate to multiple behavior styles simultaneously.
  In contrast to the well-studied areas of controllable generation of images, text,
  and speech, there are two questions that pose significant challenges when generating
  long-term behaviors: how should we specify the factors of variation to control,
  and how can we ensure that the generated behavior faithfully demonstrates combinatorially
  many styles? We leverage programmatic labeling functions to specify controllable
  styles, and derive a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective,
  which can then be solved using conventional policy learning approaches. We evaluate
  our framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents
  in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that existing approaches that do not
  explicitly enforce style-consistency fail to generate diverse behaviors whereas
  our learned policies can be calibrated for up to $4^5 (1024)$ distinct style combinations.'
