abstract: We study "adversarial scaling", a multi-armed bandit model where rewards
  have a stochastic and an adversarial component. Our model captures display advertising
  where the "click-through-rate" can be decomposed to a (fixed across time) arm-quality
  component and a non-stochastic user-relevance component (fixed across arms). Despite
  the relative stochasticity of our model, we demonstrate two settings where most
  bandit algorithms suffer. On the positive side, we show that two algorithms, one
  from the action elimination and one from the mirror descent family are adaptive
  enough to be robust to adversarial scaling. Our results shed light on the robustness
  of adaptive parameter selection in stochastic bandits, which may be of independent
  interest.
