abstract: 'We provide theoretical investigations into off-policy evaluation in reinforcement
  learning using function approximators for (marginalized) importance weights and
  value functions. Our contributions include: (1) A new estimator, MWL, that directly
  estimates importance ratios over the state-action distributions, removing the reliance
  on knowledge of the behavior policy as in prior work (Liu et.al, 2018), (2) Another
  new estimator, MQL, obtained by swapping the roles of importance weights and value-functions
  in MWL. MQL has an intuitive interpretation of minimizing average Bellman errors
  and can be combined with MWL in a doubly robust manner, (3) Several additional results
  that offer further insights, including the sample complexities of MWL and MQL, their
  asymptotic optimality in the tabular setting, how the learned importance weights
  depend the choice of the discriminator class, and how our methods provide a unified
  view of some old and new algorithms in RL.'
