abstract: We propose a novel approach to filter bank learning for time-series by considering
  spectral decompositions of signals defined as a Group Transform. This framework
  allows us to generalize classical time-frequency transformations such as the Wavelet
  Transform, and to efficiently learn the representation of signals. While the creation
  of the wavelet transform filter-bank relies on affine transformations of a mother
  filter, our approach allows for non-linear transformations. The transformations
  induced by such maps enable us to span a larger class of signal representations,
  from wavelet to chirplet-like filters. We propose a parameterization of such a non-linear
  map such that its sampling can be optimized for a specific task and signal. The
  Learnable Group Transform can be cast into a Deep Neural Network. The experiments
  on diverse time-series datasets demonstrate the expressivity of this framework,
  which competes with state-of-the-art performances.
