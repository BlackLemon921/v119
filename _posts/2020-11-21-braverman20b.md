abstract: Spectral functions of large matrices contains important structural information
  about the underlying data, and is thus becoming increasingly important. Many times,
  large matrices representing real-world data are sparse or doubly sparse (i.e., sparse
  in both rows and columns), and are accessed as a stream of updates, typically organized
  in row-order. In this setting, where space (memory) is the limiting resource, all
  known algorithms require space that is polynomial in the dimension of the matrix,
  even for sparse matrices. We address this challenge by providing the first algorithms
  whose space requirement is independent of the matrix dimension, assuming the matrix
  is doubly-sparse and presented in row-order. Our algorithms approximate the Schatten
  p-norms, which we use in turn to approximate other spectral functions, such as logarithm
  of the determinant, trace of matrix inverse, and Estrada index. We validate these
  theoretical performance bounds by numerical experiments on real-world matrices representing
  social networks. We further prove that multiple passes are unavoidable in this setting,
  and show extensions of our primary technique, including a trade-off between space
  requirements and number of passes.
