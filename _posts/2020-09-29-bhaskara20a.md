abstract: 'We consider a variant of the classical online linear optimization problem
  in which at every step, the online player receives a “hint” vector before choosing
  the action for that round. Rather surprisingly, it was shown that if the hint vector
  is guaranteed to have a positive correlation with the cost vector, then the online
  player can achieve a regret of $O(\log T)$, thus significantly improving over the
  $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the general setting. However, the result and analysis require
  the correlation property at \emph{all} time steps, thus raising the natural question:
  can we design online learning algorithms that are resilient to bad hints? In this
  paper we develop algorithms and nearly matching lower bounds for online learning
  with imperfect hints. Our algorithms are oblivious to the quality of the hints,
  and the regret bounds interpolate between the always-correlated hints case and the
  no-hints case. Our results also generalize, simplify, and improve upon previous
  results on optimistic regret bounds, which can be viewed as an additive version
  of hints.'
