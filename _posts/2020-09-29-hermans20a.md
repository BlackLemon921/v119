abstract: Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly
  common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations.
  Typically, these forward models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners
  to rely on approximations. This work introduces a novel approach to address the
  intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model. We achieve this by learning
  a flexible amortized estimator which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio.
  We demonstrate that the learned ratio estimator can be embedded in \textsc{mcmc}
  samplers to approximate likelihood-ratios between consecutive states in the Markov
  chain, allowing us to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are
  presented to improve the numerical stability and to measure the quality of an approximation.
  The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated on a variety of benchmarks against
  well-established techniques. Scientific applications in physics show its applicability.
