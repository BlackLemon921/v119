abstract: This paper studies an entropy-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization
  (MBO). Existing entropy-based MBO methods need complicated approximations to evaluate
  entropy or employ over-simplification that ignores trade-off among objectives. We
  propose a novel entropy-based MBO called Pareto-frontier entropy search (PFES),
  which is based on the information gain of Pareto-frontier. We show that our entropy
  evaluation can be reduced to a closed form whose computation is quite simple while
  capturing the trade-off relation in Pareto-frontier. We further propose an extension
  for the “decoupled” setting, in which each objective function can be observed separately,
  and show that the PFES-based approach derives a natural extension of the original
  acquisition function which can also be evaluated simply. Our numerical experiments
  show effectiveness of PFES through several benchmark datasets, and real-word datasets
  from materials science.
