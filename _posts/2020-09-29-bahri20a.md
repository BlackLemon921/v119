abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained on examples with noisy
  labels that hurt performance and are hard to identify. In this paper, we provide
  an empirical study showing that a simple $k$-nearest neighbor-based filtering approach
  on the logit layer of a preliminary model can remove mislabeled training data and
  produce more accurate models than many recently proposed methods. We also provide
  new statistical guarantees into its efficacy.
