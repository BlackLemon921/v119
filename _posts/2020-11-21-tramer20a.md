abstract: Adversarial examples are malicious inputs crafted to induce misclassification.
  Commonly studied \emph{sensitivity-based} adversarial examples introduce semantically-small
  changes to an input that result in a different model prediction. This paper studies
  a complementary failure mode, \emph{invariance-based} adversarial examples, that
  introduce minimal semantic changes that modify an input’s true label yet preserve
  the model’s prediction. We demonstrate fundamental tradeoffs between these two types
  of adversarial examples. We show that defenses against sensitivity-based attacks
  actively harm a model’s accuracy on invariance-based attacks, and that new approaches
  are needed to resist both attack types. In particular, we break state-of-the-art
  adversarially-trained and \emph{certifiably-robust} models by generating small perturbations
  that the models are (provably) robust to, yet that change an input’s class according
  to human labelers. Finally, we formally show that the existence of excessively invariant
  classifiers arises from the presence of \emph{overly-robust} predictive features
  in standard datasets.
