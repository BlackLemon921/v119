abstract: In the transfer learning problem, the target and the source data domains
  are typically known. In this article, we study a new paradigm called mutual transfer
  learning where among many heterogeneous data domains, every data domain could potentially
  be the target of interest, and it could also be a useful source to help the learning
  in other data domains. However, it is important to note that given a target not
  every data domain can be a successful source; only data sets that are similar enough
  to be thought as from the same population can be useful sources for each other.
  Under this mutual learnability assumption, a confidence distribution fusion approach
  is proposed to recover the mutual learnability relation in the transfer learning
  regime. Our proposed method achieves the same oracle statistical inferential accuracy
  as if the true learnability structure were known. It can be implemented in an efficient
  parallel fashion to deal with large-scale data. Simulated and real examples are
  analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.
