abstract: While policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) achieves tremendous successes
  in practice, it is significantly less understood in theory, especially compared
  with value-based RL. In particular, it remains elusive how to design a provably
  efficient policy optimization algorithm that incorporates exploration. To bridge
  such a gap, this paper proposes an Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization
  algorithm (OPPO), which follows an “optimistic version” of the policy gradient direction.
  This paper proves that, in the problem of episodic Markov decision process with
  linear function approximation, unknown transition, and adversarial reward with full-information
  feedback, OPPO achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2 H^3 T})$ regret. Here $d$ is the feature
  dimension, $H$ is the episode horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. To
  the best of our knowledge, OPPO is the first provably efficient policy optimization
  algorithm that explores.
