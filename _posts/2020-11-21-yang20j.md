abstract: 'The classical bias-variance trade-off predicts that bias decreases and
  variance increase with model complexity, leading to a U-shaped risk curve. Recent
  work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models,
  for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide
  a simple explanation of this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks:
  while the bias is \emph{monotonically decreasing} as in the classical theory, the
  variance is \emph{unimodal} or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the
  width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice
  of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models
  we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays
  different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance,
  with the double descent in the recent literature as a special case. We corroborate
  these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks
  with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that
  most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases
  by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias
  and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.'
