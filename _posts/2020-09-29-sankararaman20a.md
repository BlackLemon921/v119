abstract: This paper studies how neural network architecture affects the speed of
  training. We introduce a simple concept called gradient confusion to help formally
  analyze this. When gradient confusion is high, stochastic gradients produced by
  different data samples may be negatively correlated, slowing down convergence. But
  when gradient confusion is low, data samples interact harmoniously, and training
  proceeds quickly. Through theoretical and experimental results, we demonstrate how
  the neural network architecture affects gradient confusion, and thus the efficiency
  of training. Our results show that, for popular initialization techniques, increasing
  the width of neural networks leads to lower gradient confusion, and thus faster
  model training. On the other hand, increasing the depth of neural networks has the
  opposite effect. Our results indicate that alternate initialization techniques or
  networks using both batch normalization and skip connections help reduce the training
  burden of very deep networks.
