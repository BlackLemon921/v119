abstract: Using deep neural networks (DNNs) in machine learning tasks is promising
  in delivering high-quality results but challenging to meet stringent latency requirements
  and energy constraints because of the memory-bound and the compute-bound execution
  pattern of DNNs. We propose a big-little dual-module inference to dynamically skip
  unnecessary memory accesses and computations to accelerate DNN inference. Leveraging
  the noise-resilient feature of nonlinear activation functions, we propose to use
  a lightweight little module that approximates the original DNN layer, termed as
  the big module, to compute activations of the insensitive region that are more noise-resilient.
  Hence, the expensive memory accesses and computations of the big module can be reduced
  as the results are only calculated in the sensitive region. For memory-bound models
  such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), our method can reduce the overall memory
  accesses by 40% on average and achieve 1.54x to 1.75x speedup on a commodity CPU-based
  server platform with a negligible impact on model quality. In addition, our method
  can reduce the operations of the compute-bound models such as convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) by 3.02x, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop.
