abstract: Modern deep neural networks require a significant amount of computing time
  and power to train and deploy, which limits their usage on edge devices. Inspired
  by the iterative weight pruning in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, we propose DropNet,
  an iterative pruning method which prunes nodes/filters to reduce network complexity.
  DropNet iteratively removes nodes/filters with the lowest average post-activation
  value across all training samples. Empirically, we show that DropNet is robust across
  a wide range of scenarios, including MLPs and CNNs using the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
  Tiny ImageNet datasets. We show that up to 90% of the nodes/filters can be removed
  without any significant loss of accuracy. The final pruned network performs well
  even with reinitialisation of the weights and biases. DropNet also achieves similar
  accuracy to an oracle which greedily removes nodes/filters one at a time to minimise
  training loss, highlighting its effectiveness.
