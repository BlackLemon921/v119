abstract: The top-$k$ error is often employed to evaluate performance for challenging
  classification tasks in computer vision as it is designed to compensate for ambiguity
  in ground truth labels. This practical success motivates our theoretical analysis
  of consistent top-$k$ classification. To this end, we provide a characterization
  of Bayes optimality by defining a top-$k$ preserving property, which is new and
  fixes a non-uniqueness gap in prior work. Then, we define top-$k$ calibration and
  show it is necessary and sufficient for consistency. Based on the top-$k$ calibration
  analysis, we propose a rich class of top-$k$ calibrated Bregman divergence surrogates.
  Our analysis continues by showing previously proposed hinge-like top-$k$ surrogate
  losses are not top-$k$ calibrated and thus inconsistent. On the other hand, we propose
  two new hinge-like losses, one which is similarly inconsistent, and one which is
  consistent. Our empirical results highlight theoretical claims, confirming our analysis
  of the consistency of these losses.
