abstract: 'We consider the product of determinantal point processes (DPPs), a point
  process whose probability mass is proportional to the product of principal minors
  of multiple matrices as a natural, promising generalization of DPPs. We study the
  computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which is among the
  most essential probabilistic inference tasks. Our complexity-theoretic results (almost)
  rule out the existence of efficient algorithms for this task, unless input matrices
  are forced to have favorable structures. In particular, we prove the following:
  (1) Computing $\sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S})^p$ exactly for every (fixed) positive
  even integer $p$ is $\textsf{UP}$-hard and $\textsf{Mod}_3\textsf{P}$-hard, which
  gives a negative answer to an open question posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012).
  (2) $\sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S}) \det(\mathbf{B}_{S,S}) \det(\mathbf{C}_{S,S})$
  is $\textsf{NP}$-hard to approximate within a factor of $ 2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{I}|^{1-\epsilon})}
  $ for any $\epsilon > 0$, where $|\mathcal{I}|$ is the input size. This result is
  stronger than $\sharp\textsf{P}$-hardness for the case of two matrices by Gillenwater
  (2014). (3) There exists a $ k^{\mathcal{O}(k)} |\mathcal{I}|^{\mathcal{O}(1)} $-time
  algorithm for computing $\sum_{S} \det(\mathbf{A}_{S,S}) \det(\mathbf{B}_{S,S})$,
  where $k$ is “the maximum rank of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$” or “the treewidth
  of the graph formed by nonzero entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.” Such parameterized
  algorithms are said to be fixed-parameter tractable.'
