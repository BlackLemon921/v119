abstract: One of the most effective algorithms for differentially private learning
  and optimization is \emph{objective perturbation}. This technique augments a given
  optimization problem (e.g. deriving from an ERM problem) with a random linear term,
  and then exactly solves it. However, to date, analyses of this approach crucially
  rely on the convexity and smoothness of the objective function. We give two algorithms
  that extend this approach substantially. The first algorithm requires nothing except
  boundedness of the loss function, and operates over a discrete domain. Its privacy
  and accuracy guarantees hold even without assuming convexity. We are able to extend
  traditional analyses of objective perturbation by introducing a novel “normalization“
  step into the algorithm, which provides enough stability to be differentially private
  even without second-order conditions. The second algorithm operates over a continuous
  domain and requires only that the loss function be bounded and Lipschitz in its
  continuous parameter. Its privacy analysis does not even require convexity. Its
  accuracy analysis does require convexity, but does not require second order conditions
  like smoothness. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation
  of the non-convex case, in which we use an integer program solver as our optimization
  oracle. We find that for the problem of learning linear classifiers, directly optimizing
  for 0/1 loss using our approach can out-perform the more standard approach of privately
  optimizing a convex-surrogate loss function on the Adult dataset.
