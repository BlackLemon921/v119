abstract: Consider N cooperative but non-communicating players where each plays one
  out of M arms for T turns. Players have different utilities for each arm, representable
  as an NxM matrix. These utilities are unknown to the players. In each turn players
  receive noisy observations of their utility for their selected arm. However, if
  any other players selected the same arm that turn, they will all receive zero utility
  due to the conflict. No other communication or coordination between the players
  is possible. Our goal is to design a distributed algorithm that learns the matching
  between players and arms that achieves max-min fairness while minimizing the regret.
  We present an algorithm and prove that it is regret optimal up to a \log\log T factor.
  This is the first max-min fairness multi-player bandit algorithm with (near) order
  optimal regret.
