abstract: Dense subgraph discovery aims to find a dense component in edge-weighted
  graphs. This is a fundamental graph-mining task with a variety of applications and
  thus has received much attention recently. Although most existing methods assume
  that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption is not necessarily
  valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning problem for dense
  subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge subsets rather than only single
  edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights in a queried subset. For this problem,
  we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution
  with high probability. Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more
  scalable algorithm with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using
  real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
