abstract: We consider the problem of the limited-bandwidth communication for multi-agent
  reinforcement learning, where agents cooperate with the assistance of a communication
  protocol and a scheduler. The protocol and scheduler jointly determine which agent
  is communicating what message and to whom. Under the limited bandwidth constraint,
  a communication protocol is required to generate informative messages. Meanwhile,
  an unnecessary communication connection should not be established because it occupies
  limited resources in vain. In this paper, we develop an Informative Multi-Agent
  Communication (IMAC) method to learn efficient communication protocols as well as
  scheduling. First, from the perspective of communication theory, we prove that the
  limited bandwidth constraint requires low-entropy messages throughout the transmission.
  Then inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we learn a valuable and compact
  communication protocol and a weight-based scheduler. To demonstrate the efficiency
  of our method, we conduct extensive experiments in various cooperative and competitive
  multi-agent tasks with different numbers of agents and different bandwidths. We
  show that IMAC converges faster and leads to efficient communication among agents
  under the limited bandwidth as compared to many baseline methods.
