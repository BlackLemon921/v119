abstract: We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex optimization
  of a continuous and parameterized objective function and introduce a differentiable
  variant that enables us to differentiate the output of CEM with respect to the objective
  functionâ€™s parameters. In the machine learning setting this brings CEM inside of
  the end-to-end learning pipeline where this has otherwise been impossible. We show
  applications in a synthetic energy-based structured prediction task and in non-convex
  continuous control. In the control setting we show how to embed optimal action sequences
  into a lower-dimensional space. This enables us to use policy optimization to fine-tune
  modeling components by differentiating through the CEM-based controller.
