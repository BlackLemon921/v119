abstract: We investigate the ability of popular flow models to capture tail-properties
  of a target density by studying the increasing triangular maps used in these flow
  methods acting on a tractable source density. We show that the density quantile
  functions of the source and target density provide a precise characterization of
  the slope of transformation required to capture tails in a target density. We further
  show that any Lipschitz-continuous transport map acting on a source density will
  result in a density with similar tail properties as the source, highlighting the
  trade-off between the importance of choosing a complex source density and a sufficiently
  expressive transformation to capture desirable properties of a target density. Subsequently,
  we illustrate that flow models like Real-NVP, MAF, and Glow as implemented lack
  the ability to capture a distribution with non-Gaussian tails. We circumvent this
  problem by proposing tail-adaptive flows consisting of a source distribution that
  can be learned simultaneously with the triangular map to capture tail-properties
  of a target density. We perform several synthetic and real-world experiments to
  complement our theoretical findings.
