abstract: We introduce a new non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for ordinal
  data, called OrdNMF. Ordinal data are categorical data which exhibit a natural ordering
  between the categories. In particular, they can be found in recommender systems,
  either with explicit data (such as ratings) or implicit data (such as quantized
  play counts). OrdNMF is a probabilistic latent factor model that generalizes Bernoulli-Poisson
  factorization (BePoF) and Poisson factorization (PF) applied to binarized data.
  Contrary to these methods, OrdNMF circumvents binarization and can exploit a more
  informative representation of the data. We design an efficient variational algorithm
  based on a suitable model augmentation and related to variational PF. In particular,
  our algorithm preserves the scalability of PF and can be applied to huge sparse
  datasets. We report recommendation experiments on explicit and implicit datasets,
  and show that OrdNMF outperforms BePoF and PF applied to binarized data.
