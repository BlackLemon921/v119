abstract: Node classification in attributed graphs is an important task in multiple
  practical settings, but it can often be difficult or expensive to obtain labels.
  Active learning can improve the achieved classification performance for a given
  budget on the number of queried labels. The best existing methods are based on graph
  neural networks, but they often perform poorly unless a sizeable validation set
  of labelled nodes is available in order to choose good hyperparameters. We propose
  a novel graph-based active learning algorithm for the task of node classification
  in attributed graphs; our algorithm uses graph cognizant logistic regression, equivalent
  to a linearized graph-convolutional neural network (GCN), for the prediction phase
  and maximizes the expected error reduction in the query phase. To reduce the delay
  experienced by a labeller interacting with the system, we derive a preemptive querying
  system that calculates a new query during the labelling process, and to address
  the setting where learning starts with almost no labelled data, we also develop
  a hybrid algorithm that performs adaptive model averaging of label propagation and
  linearized GCN inference. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets,
  demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches and illustrate
  the practical value of the method by applying it to a private microwave link network
  dataset.
