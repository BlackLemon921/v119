abstract: Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) is the problem of finding the relevant
  labels for an input, from a very large universe of possible labels. We consider
  XMC in the setting where labels are available only for groups of samples - but not
  for individual ones. Current XMC approaches are not built for such multi-instance
  multi-label (MIML) training data, and MIML approaches do not scale to XMC sizes.
  We develop a new and scalable algorithm to impute individual-sample labels from
  the group labels; this can be paired with any existing XMC method to solve the aggregated
  label problem. We characterize the statistical properties of our algorithm under
  mild assumptions, and provide a new end-to-end framework for MIML as an extension.
  Experiments on both aggregated label XMC and MIML tasks show the advantages over
  existing approaches.
