abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel form of value function, $Q(s, s’)$,
  that expresses the utility of transitioning from a state $s$ to a neighboring state
  $s’$ and then acting optimally thereafter. In order to derive an optimal policy,
  we develop a forward dynamics model that learns to make next-state predictions that
  maximize this value. This formulation decouples actions from values while still
  learning off-policy. We highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of value
  function transfer, learning within redundant action spaces, and learning off-policy
  from state observations generated by sub-optimal or completely random policies.
