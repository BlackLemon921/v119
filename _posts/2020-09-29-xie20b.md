abstract: While successful in many fields, deep neural networks (DNNs) still suffer
  from some open problems such as bad local minima and unsatisfactory generalization
  performance. In this work, we propose a novel architecture called Maximum-and-Concatenation
  Networks (MCN) to try eliminating bad local minima and improving generalization
  ability as well. Remarkably, we prove that MCN has a very nice property; that is,
  every local minimum of an (l+1)-layer MCN can be better than, at least as good as,
  the global minima of the network consisting of its first l layers. In other words,
  by increasing the network depth, MCN can autonomously improve its local minimaâ€™s
  goodness, what is more, it is easy to plug MCN into an existing deep model to make
  it also have this property. Finally, under mild conditions, we show that MCN can
  approximate certain continuous function arbitrarily well with high efficiency; that
  is, the covering number of MCN is much smaller than most existing DNNs such as deep
  ReLU. Based on this, we further provide a tight generalization bound to guarantee
  the inference ability of MCN when dealing with testing samples.
