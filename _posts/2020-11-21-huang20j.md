abstract: In the paper, we propose a class of accelerated stochastic gradient-free
  and projection-free (a.k.a., zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe) methods to solve the constrained
  stochastic and finite-sum nonconvex optimization. Specifically, we propose an accelerated
  stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW) method based on the variance reduced
  technique of SPIDER/SpiderBoost and a novel momentum accelerated technique. Moreover,
  under some mild conditions, we prove that the Acc-SZOFW has the function query complexity
  of $O(d\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the
  finite-sum problem, which improves the exiting best result by a factor of $O(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$,
  and has the function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-3})$ in the stochastic problem,
  which improves the exiting best result by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. To relax
  the large batches required in the Acc-SZOFW, we further propose a novel accelerated
  stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (Acc-SZOFW*) based on a new variance reduced
  technique of STORM, which still reaches the function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-3})$
  in the stochastic problem without relying on any large batches. In particular, we
  present an accelerated framework of the Frank-Wolfe methods based on the proposed
  momentum accelerated technique. The extensive experimental results on black-box
  adversarial attack and robust black-box classification demonstrate the efficiency
  of our algorithms.
