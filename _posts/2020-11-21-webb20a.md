abstract: Extrapolation – the ability to make inferences that go beyond the scope
  of one’s experiences – is a hallmark of human intelligence. By contrast, the generalization
  exhibited by contemporary neural network algorithms is largely limited to interpolation
  between data points in their training corpora. In this paper, we consider the challenge
  of learning representations that support extrapolation. We introduce a novel visual
  analogy benchmark that allows the graded evaluation of extrapolation as a function
  of distance from the convex domain defined by the training data. We also introduce
  a simple technique, temporal context normalization, that encourages representations
  that emphasize the relations between objects. We find that this technique enables
  a significant improvement in the ability to extrapolate, considerably outperforming
  a number of competitive techniques.
