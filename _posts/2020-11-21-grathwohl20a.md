abstract: We present a new method for evaluating and training unnormalized density
  models. Our approach only requires access to the gradient of the unnormalized modelâ€™s
  log-density. We estimate the Stein discrepancy between the data density p(x) and
  the model density q(x) based on a vector function of the data. We parameterize this
  function with a neural network and fit its parameters to maximize this discrepancy.
  This yields a novel goodness-of-fit test which outperforms existing methods on high
  dimensional data. Furthermore, optimizing q(x) to minimize this discrepancy produces
  a novel method for training unnormalized models. This training method can fit large
  unnormalized models faster than existing approaches. The ability to both learn and
  compare models is a unique feature of the proposed method.
