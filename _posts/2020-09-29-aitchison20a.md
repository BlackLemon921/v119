abstract: 'Recent work has argued that neural networks can be understood theoretically
  by taking the number of channels to infinity, at which point the outputs become
  Gaussian process (GP) distributed. However, we note that infinite Bayesian neural
  networks lack a key facet of the behaviour of real neural networks: the fixed kernel,
  determined only by network hyperparameters, implies that they cannot do any form
  of representation learning. The lack of representation or equivalently kernel learning
  leads to less flexibility and hence worse performance, giving a potential explanation
  for the inferior performance of infinite networks observed in the literature (e.g.
  Novak et al. 2019). We give analytic results characterising the prior over representations
  and representation learning in finite deep linear networks. We show empirically
  that the representations in SOTA architectures such as ResNets trained with SGD
  are much closer to those suggested by our deep linear results than by the corresponding
  infinite network. This motivates the introduction of a new class of network: infinite
  networks with bottlenecks, which inherit the theoretical tractability of infinite
  networks while at the same time allowing representation learning.'
