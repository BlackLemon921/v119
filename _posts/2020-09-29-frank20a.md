abstract: Deep neural networks can generate images that are astonishingly realistic,
  so much so that it is often hard for humans to distinguish them from actual photos.
  These achievements have been largely made possible by Generative Adversarial Networks
  (GANs). While deep fake images have been thoroughly investigated in the image domain{—}a
  classical approach from the area of image forensics{—}an analysis in the frequency
  domain has been missing so far. In this paper,we address this shortcoming and our
  results reveal that in frequency space, GAN-generated images exhibit severe artifacts
  that can be easily identified. We perform a comprehensive analysis, showing that
  these artifacts are consistent across different neural network architectures, data
  sets, and resolutions. In a further investigation, we demonstrate that these artifacts
  are caused by upsampling operations found in all current GAN architectures, indicating
  a structural and fundamental problem in the way images are generated via GANs. Based
  on this analysis, we demonstrate how the frequency representation can be used to
  identify deep fake images in an automated way, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.
