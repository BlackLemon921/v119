abstract: Games are an increasingly useful tool for training and testing learning
  algorithms. Recent examples include GANs, AlphaZero and the AlphaStar league. However,
  multi-agent learning can be extremely difficult to predict and control. Learning
  dynamics even in simple games can yield chaotic behavior. In this paper, we present
  basic \emph{mechanism design} tools for constructing games with predictable and
  controllable dynamics. We show that arbitrarily large and complex network games,
  encoding both cooperation (team play) and competition (zero-sum interaction), exhibit
  conservation laws when agents use the standard regret-minimizing dynamics known
  as Follow-the-Regularized-Leader. These laws persist when different agents use different
  dynamics and encode long-range correlations between agentsâ€™ behavior, even though
  the agents may not interact directly. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions
  under which the dynamics have multiple, linearly independent, conservation laws.
  Increasing the number of conservation laws results in more predictable dynamics,
  eventually making chaotic behavior formally impossible in some cases.
