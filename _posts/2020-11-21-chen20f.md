abstract: Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a prevailing NAS solution
  to identify architectures. Based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture
  space, DARTS learns a differentiable architecture weight and largely reduces the
  search cost. However, its stability has been challenged for yielding deteriorating
  architectures as the search proceeds. We find that the precipitous validation loss
  landscape, which leads to a dramatic performance drop when distilling the final
  architecture, is an essential factor that causes instability. Based on this observation,
  we propose a perturbation-based regularization - SmoothDARTS (SDARTS), to smooth
  the loss landscape and improve the generalizability of DARTS-based methods. In particular,
  our new formulations stabilize DARTS-based methods by either random smoothing or
  adversarial attack. The search trajectory on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 demonstrates the effectiveness
  of our approach and due to the improved stability, we achieve performance gain across
  various search spaces on 4 datasets. Furthermore, we mathematically show that SDARTS
  implicitly regularizes the Hessian norm of the validation loss, which accounts for
  a smoother loss landscape and improved performance.
