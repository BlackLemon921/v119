abstract: 'Graph representation learning is a ubiquitous task in machine learning
  where the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We consider
  the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical
  estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution:
  the bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family
  distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of
  two one-layer neural networks that take high-dimensional features as inputs, while
  nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. In this setting, the representation
  learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices, and the main challenges
  of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric
  nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose
  a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and
  show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the
  ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence
  rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in
  dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian
  models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the
  exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.'
