abstract: We introduce a new class of inter-domain variational Gaussian processes
  (GP) where data is mapped onto the unit hypersphere in order to use spherical harmonic
  representations. Our inference scheme is comparable to variational Fourier features,
  but it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and leads to diagonal covariance
  matrices between inducing variables. This enables a speed-up in inference, because
  it bypasses the need to invert large covariance matrices. Our experiments show that
  our model is able to fit a regression model for a dataset with 6 million entries
  two orders of magnitude faster compared to standard sparse GPs, while retaining
  state of the art accuracy. We also demonstrate competitive performance on classification
  with non-conjugate likelihoods.
