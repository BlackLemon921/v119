abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of post-hoc calibration of machine learning
  classifiers. We introduce the following desiderata for uncertainty calibration:
  (a) accuracy-preserving, (b) data-efficient, and (c) high expressive power. We show
  that none of the existing methods satisfy all three requirements, and demonstrate
  how Mix-n-Match calibration strategies (i.e., ensemble and composition) can help
  achieve remarkably better data-efficiency and expressive power while provably maintaining
  the classification accuracy of the original classifier. Mix-n-Match strategies are
  generic in the sense that they can be used to improve the performance of any off-the-shelf
  calibrator. We also reveal potential issues in standard evaluation practices. Popular
  approaches (e.g., histogram-based expected calibration error (ECE)) may provide
  misleading results especially in small-data regime. Therefore, we propose an alternative
  data-efficient kernel density-based estimator for a reliable evaluation of the calibration
  performance and prove its asymptotically unbiasedness and consistency. Our approaches
  outperform state-of-the-art solutions on both the calibration as well as the evaluation
  tasks in most of the experimental settings. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zhang64-
