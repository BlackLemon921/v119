abstract: Boosting is a technique that boosts a weak and inaccurate machine learning
  algorithm into a strong accurate learning algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm by Freund
  and Schapire (for which they were awarded the G{ö}del prize in 2003) is one of the
  widely used boosting algorithms, with many applications in theory and practice.
  Suppose we have a gamma-weak learner for a Boolean concept class C that takes time
  R(C), then the time complexity of AdaBoost scales as VC(C)poly(R(C), 1/gamma), where
  VC(C) is the VC-dimension of C. In this paper, we show how quantum techniques can
  improve the time complexity of classical AdaBoost. To this end, suppose we have
  a gamma-weak quantum learning algorithm for a Boolean concept class C that takes
  time Q(C), we introduce a quantum boosting algorithm whose complexity scales as
  sqrt{VC(C)}poly(Q(C),1/gamma); thereby achieving quadratic quantum improvement over
  classical AdaBoost in terms of  VC(C).
