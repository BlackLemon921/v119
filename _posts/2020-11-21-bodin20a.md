abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) methods often rely on the assumption that the
  objective function is well-behaved, but in practice, this is seldom true for real-world
  objectives even if noise-free observations can be collected. Common approaches,
  which try to model the objective as precisely as possible, often fail to make progress
  by spending too many evaluations modeling irrelevant details. We address this issue
  by proposing surrogate models that focus on the well-behaved structure in the objective
  function, which is informative for search, while ignoring detrimental structure
  that is challenging to model from few observations. First, we demonstrate that surrogate
  models with appropriate noise distributions can absorb challenging structures in
  the objective function by treating them as irreducible uncertainty. Secondly, we
  show that a latent Gaussian process is an excellent surrogate for this purpose,
  comparing with Gaussian processes with standard noise distributions. We perform
  numerous experiments on a range of BO benchmarks and find that our approach improves
  reliability and performance when faced with challenging objective functions.
