abstract: Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling problems,
  especially in cases where a model’s success hinges upon its ability to faithfully
  represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist as parts of larger
  frameworks, wherein quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating
  over posterior distributions. These quantities are frequently intractable, motivating
  the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian
  processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their
  posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We
  identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable
  sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this factorization,
  we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling,
  which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford scalability both during
  training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test competing
  sampling schemes’ statistical properties and practical ramifications, we demonstrate
  how decoupled sample paths accurately represent Gaussian process posteriors at a
  fraction of the usual cost.
