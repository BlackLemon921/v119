abstract: Existing approaches to federated learning suffer from a communication bottleneck
  as well as convergence issues due to sparse client participation. In this paper
  we introduce a novel algorithm,called FetchSGD, to overcome these challenges. FetchSGD
  compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability
  of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design
  of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation
  can both be carried out within the sketch.This allows the algorithm to move momentum
  and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges
  of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and
  good convergence. We prove that FetchSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and
  we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and
  a transformer model.
