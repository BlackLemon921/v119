abstract: A general framework for online learning with partial information is one
  where feedback graphs specify which losses can be observed by the learner. We study
  a challenging scenario where feedback graphs vary stochastically with time and,
  more importantly, where graphs and losses are dependent. This scenario appears in
  several real-world applications that we describe where the outcome of actions are
  correlated. We devise a new algorithm for this setting that exploits the stochastic
  properties of the graphs and that benefits from favorable regret guarantees. We
  present a detailed theoretical analysis of this algorithm, and also report the result
  of a series of experiments on real-world datasets, which show that our algorithm
  outperforms standard baselines for online learning with feedback graphs.
