abstract: Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on large datasets
  has developed rapidly in recent years. However, the underlying methods are generally
  limited to relatively simple settings where the data have specific forms of independence.
  We propose a novel technique for speeding up MCMC for time series data by efficient
  data subsampling in the frequency domain. For several challenging time series models,
  we demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude while incurring negligible
  bias compared to MCMC on the full dataset. We also propose alternative control variates
  for variance reduction based on data grouping and coreset constructions.
