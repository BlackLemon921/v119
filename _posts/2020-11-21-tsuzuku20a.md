abstract: The notion of flat minima has gained attention as a key metric of the generalization
  ability of deep learning models. However, current definitions of flatness are known
  to be sensitive to parameter rescaling. While some previous studies have proposed
  to rescale flatness metrics using parameter scales to avoid the scale dependence,
  the normalized metrics lose the direct theoretical connections between flat minima
  and generalization. In this paper, we first provide generalization error bounds
  using existing normalized flatness measures. Using the analysis, we then propose
  a novel normalized flatness metric. The proposed metric enjoys both direct theoretical
  connections and better empirical correlation to generalization error.
