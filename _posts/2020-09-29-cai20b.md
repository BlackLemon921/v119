abstract: In the current era of personalized recommendation, one major interest is
  to develop an optimal individualized decision rule that assigns individuals with
  the best treatment option according to their covariates. Estimation of optimal decision
  rules (ODR) has been extensively investigated recently, however, at present, no
  testing procedure is proposed to verify whether these ODRs are significantly better
  than the naive decision rule that always assigning individuals to a fixed treatment
  option. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure for detecting the existence
  of an ODR that is better than the naive decision rule under the randomized trials.
  We construct the proposed test based on the difference of estimated value functions
  using the augmented inverse probability weighted method. The asymptotic distributions
  of the proposed test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses are
  established. Based on the established asymptotic distributions, we further develop
  a sample size calculation formula for testing the existence of an ODR in designing
  A/B tests. Extensive simulations and a real data application to a schizophrenia
  clinical trial data are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed
  methods.
