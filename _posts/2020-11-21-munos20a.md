abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of algorithms, called Mirror Ascent against
  an Improved Opponent (MAIO), for computing Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum
  games, both in normal form and in sequential form with imperfect information. These
  algorithms update the policy of each player with a mirror-ascent step to maximize
  the value of playing against an improved opponent. An improved opponent can be a
  best response, a greedy policy, a policy improved by policy gradient, or by any
  other reinforcement learning or search techniques. We establish a convergence result
  of the last iterate to the set of Nash equilibria and show that the speed of convergence
  depends on the amount of improvement offered by these improved policies. In addition,
  we show that under some condition, if we use a best response as improved policy,
  then an exponential convergence rate is achieved.
