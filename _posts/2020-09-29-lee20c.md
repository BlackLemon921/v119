abstract: Self-supervised learning, which learns by constructing artificial labels
  given only the input signals, has recently gained considerable attention for learning
  representations with unlabeled datasets, i.e., learning without any human-annotated
  supervision. In this paper, we show that such a technique can be used to significantly
  improve the model accuracy even under fully-labeled datasets. Our scheme trains
  the model to learn both original and self-supervised tasks, but is different from
  conventional multi-task learning frameworks that optimize the summation of their
  corresponding losses. Our main idea is to learn a single unified task with respect
  to the joint distribution of the original and self-supervised labels, i.e., we augment
  original labels via self-supervision. This simple, yet effective approach allows
  to train models easier by relaxing a certain invariant constraint during learning
  the original and self-supervised tasks simultaneously. It also enables an aggregated
  inference which combines the predictions from different augmentations to improve
  the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique,
  which we refer to as self-distillation, that has the effect of the aggregated inference
  in a single (faster) inference. We demonstrate the large accuracy improvement and
  wide applicability of our framework on various fully-supervised settings, e.g.,
  the few-shot and imbalanced classification scenarios.
