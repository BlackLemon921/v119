abstract: We propose a modeling framework for event data and aim to answer questions
  such as \emph{when} and \emph{why} the next event would happen. Our proposed model
  excels in small data regime with the ability to incorporate domain knowledge in
  terms of logic rules. We model the dynamics of the event starts and ends via intensity
  function with the structures informed by a set of first-order temporal logic rules.
  Using the softened representation of temporal relations, and a weighted combination
  of logic rules, our probabilistic model can deal with uncertainty in events. Furthermore,
  many well-known point processes (e.g., Hawkes process, self-correcting point process)
  can be interpreted as special cases of our model given simple temporal logic rules.
  Our model, therefore, riches the family of point processes. We derive a maximum
  likelihood estimation procedure for our model and show that it can lead to accurate
  predictions when data are sparse and domain knowledge is critical.
