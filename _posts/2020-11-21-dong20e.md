abstract: We propose an efficient inference method for switching nonlinear dynamical
  systems. The key idea is to learn an inference network which can be used as a proposal
  distribution for the continuous latent variables, while performing exact marginalization
  of the discrete latent variables. This allows us to use the reparameterization trick,
  and apply end-to-end training with stochastic gradient descent. We show that the
  proposed method can successfully segment time series data, including videos and
  3D human pose, into meaningful “regimes” by using the piece-wise nonlinear dynamics.
