abstract: Great computational effort is invested in generating equilibrium states
  for molecular systems using, for example, Markov chain Monte Carlo. We present a
  probabilistic model that generates statistically independent samples for molecules
  from their graph representations. Our model learns a low-dimensional manifold that
  preserves the geometry of local atomic neighborhoods through a principled learning
  representation that is based on Euclidean distance geometry. In a new benchmark
  for molecular conformation generation, we show experimentally that our generative
  model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Finally, we show how to use our model
  as a proposal distribution in an importance sampling scheme to compute molecular
  properties.
