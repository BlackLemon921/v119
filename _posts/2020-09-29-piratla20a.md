abstract: 'Domain generalization refers to the task of training a model which generalizes
  to new domains that are not seen during training. We present CSD (Common Specific
  Decomposition), for this setting, which jointly learns a common component (which
  generalizes to new domains) and a domain specific component (which overfits on training
  domains). The domain specific components are discarded after training and only the
  common component is retained. The algorithm is extremely simple and involves only
  modifying the final linear classification layer of any given neural network architecture.
  We present a principled analysis to understand existing approaches, provide identifiability
  results of CSD, and study the effect of low-rank on domain generalization. We show
  that CSD either matches or beats state of the art approaches for domain generalization
  based on domain erasure, domain perturbed data augmentation, and meta-learning.
  Further diagnostics on rotated MNIST, where domains are interpretable, confirm the
  hypothesis that CSD successfully disentangles common and domain specific components
  and hence leads to better domain generalization; moreover, our code and dataset
  are publicly available at the following URL: \url{https://github.com/vihari/csd}.'
