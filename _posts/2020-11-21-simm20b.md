abstract: Automating molecular design using deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds
  the promise of accelerating the discovery of new chemical compounds. Existing approaches
  work with molecular graphs and thus ignore the location of atoms in space, which
  restricts them to 1) generating single organic molecules and 2) heuristic reward
  functions. To address this, we present a novel RL formulation for molecular design
  in Cartesian coordinates, thereby extending the class of molecules that can be built.
  Our reward function is directly based on fundamental physical properties such as
  the energy, which we approximate via fast quantum-chemical methods. To enable progress
  towards de-novo molecular design, we introduce MolGym, an RL environment comprising
  several challenging molecular design tasks along with baselines. In our experiments,
  we show that our agent can efficiently learn to solve these tasks from scratch by
  working in a translation and rotation invariant state-action space.
