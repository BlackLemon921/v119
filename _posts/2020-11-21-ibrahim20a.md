abstract: Recent successes of game-theoretic formulations in ML have caused a resurgence
  of research interest in differentiable games. Overwhelmingly, that research focuses
  on methods and upper bounds on their speed of convergence. In this work, we approach
  the question of fundamental iteration complexity by providing lower bounds to complement
  the linear (i.e. geometric) upper bounds observed in the literature on a wide class
  of problems. We cast saddle-point and min-max problems as 2-player games. We leverage
  tools from single-objective convex optimisation to propose new linear lower bounds
  for convex-concave games. Notably, we give a linear lower bound for $n$-player differentiable
  games, by using the spectral properties of the update operator. We then propose
  a new definition of the condition number arising from our lower bound analysis.
  Unlike past definitions, our condition number captures the fact that linear rates
  are possible in games, even in the absence of strong convexity or strong concavity
  in the variables.
