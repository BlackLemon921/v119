abstract: 'Transformers have increasingly outperformed gated RNNs in obtaining new
  state-of-the-art results on supervised tasks involving text sequences. Inspired
  by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve
  the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory
  Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a dynamic
  set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three
  environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that
  requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that
  involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that
  the combination of WMGâ€™s Transformer-based architecture with factored observation
  spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures
  across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically
  boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored.'
