abstract: Although SGD with random reshuffle has been widely-used in machine learning
  applications, there is a limited understanding of how model characteristics affect
  the convergence of the algorithm. In this work, we introduce model incoherence to
  characterize the diversity of model characteristics and study its impact on convergence
  of SGD with random reshuffle under weak strong convexity. Specifically, minimizer
  incoherence measures the discrepancy between the global minimizers of a sample loss
  and those of the total loss and affects the convergence error of SGD with random
  reshuffle. In particular, we show that the variable sequence generated by SGD with
  random reshuffle converges to a certain global minimizer of the total loss under
  full minimizer coherence. The other curvature incoherence measures the quality of
  condition numbers of the sample losses and determines the convergence rate of SGD.
  With model incoherence, our results show that SGD has a faster convergence rate
  and smaller convergence error under random reshuffle than those under random sampling,
  and hence provide justifications to the superior practical performance of SGD with
  random reshuffle.
