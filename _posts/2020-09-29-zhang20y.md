abstract: Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have made great progress recently
  on learning from graph-structured data in practice, their theoretical guarantee
  on generalizability remains elusive in the literature. In this paper, we provide
  a theoretically-grounded generalizability analysis of GNNs with one hidden layer
  for both regression and binary classification problems. Under the assumption that
  there exists a ground-truth GNN model (with zero generalization error), the objective
  of GNN learning is to estimate the ground-truth GNN parameters from the training
  data. To achieve this objective, we propose a learning algorithm that is built on
  tensor initialization and accelerated gradient descent. We then show that the proposed
  learning algorithm converges to the ground-truth GNN model for the regression problem,
  and to a model sufficiently close to the ground-truth for the binary classification
  problem. Moreover, for both cases, the convergence rate of the proposed learning
  algorithm is proven to be linear and faster than the vanilla gradient descent algorithm.
  We further explore the relationship between the sample complexity of GNNs and their
  underlying graph properties. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate
  the validity of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm
  for GNNs.
