abstract: 'In this paper, we present a Bayesian Moment Matching (BMM) based method
  aimed at solving the initialization problem in Boolean SAT solvers. The initialization
  problem can be stated as follows: given a SAT formula $\phi$, compute an initial
  order over the variables of $\phi$ and values/polarity for these variables such
  that the runtime of SAT solvers on input $\phi$ is minimized. At the start of a
  solver run, our BMM-based methods compute a posterior probability distribution for
  an assignment to the variables of the input formula after analyzing its clauses,
  which will then be used by the solver to initialize its search. We perform extensive
  experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our BMM-based heuristic against 4 other
  initialization methods (random, survey propagation, Jeroslow-Wang, and default)
  in state-of-the-art solvers, MapleCOMSPS and MapleLCMDistChronotBT over the SAT
  competition 2018 application benchmark, as well as the best-known solvers in the
  cryptographic category, namely, CryptoMiniSAT, Glucose, and MapleSAT. On the cryptographic
  benchmark, BMM-based solvers out-perform all other initialization methods. Further,
  the BMM-based MapleCOMSPS significantly out-perform the same solver using all other
  initialization methods by 12 additional instances solved and better average runtime,
  over the SAT 2018 competition benchmark.'
