abstract: 'The empirical performance of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs)
  is significantly inferior to discrete-layer models on benchmark tasks (e.g. image
  classification). We demonstrate an explanation is the inaccuracy of existing gradient
  estimation methods: the adjoint method has numerical errors in reverse-mode integration;
  the naive method suffers from a redundantly deep computation graph. We propose the
  Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy
  which records the forward- mode trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee
  accuracy; ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA
  supports adaptive solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint
  and naive method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE
  trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest reliability.
  On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods. Furthermore, NODE with
  ACA can incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy.'
