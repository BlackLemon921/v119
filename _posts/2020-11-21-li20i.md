abstract: We tackle the problem disentangling the latent space of an autoencoder in
  order to separate labelled attribute information from other characteristic information.
  This then allows us to change selected attributes while preserving other information.
  Our method, matrix subspace projection, is much simpler than previous approaches
  to latent space factorisation, for example not requiring multiple discriminators
  or a careful weighting among their loss functions. Furthermore our new model can
  be applied to autoencoders as a plugin, and works across diverse domains such as
  images or text. We demonstrate the utility of our method for attribute manipulation
  in autoencoders trained across varied domains, using both human evaluation and automated
  methods. The quality of generation of our new model (e.g. reconstruction, conditional
  generation) is highly competitive to a number of strong baselines.
