abstract: Policy learning using historical observational data is an important problem
  that has found widespread applications. However, existing literature rests on the
  crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
  deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data{â€“}an assumption
  that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper, we lift this
  assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with bandit observational
  data. We propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a robust policy
  to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts. We first present a policy
  evaluation procedure in the ambiguous environment and also give a heuristic algorithm
  to solve the distributionally robust policy learning problems efficiently. Additionally,
  we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of our policy.
