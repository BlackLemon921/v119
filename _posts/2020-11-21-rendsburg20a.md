abstract: 'A graph generative model takes a graph as input and is supposed to generate
  new graphs that “look like” the input graph. While most classical models focus on
  few, hand-selected graph statistics and are too simplistic to reproduce real-world
  graphs, NetGAN recently emerged as an attractive alternative: by training a GAN
  to learn the random walk distribution of the input graph, the algorithm is able
  to reproduce a large number of important network patterns simultaneously, without
  explicitly specifying any of them. In this paper, we investigate the implicit bias
  of NetGAN. We find that the root of its generalization properties does not lie in
  the GAN architecture, but in an inconspicuous low-rank approximation of the logits
  random walk transition matrix. Step by step we can strip NetGAN of all unnecessary
  parts, including the GAN, and obtain a highly simplified reformulation that achieves
  comparable generalization results, but is orders of magnitudes faster and easier
  to adapt. Being much simpler on the conceptual side, we reveal the implicit inductive
  bias of the algorithm — an important step towards increasing the interpretability,
  transparency and acceptance of machine learning systems.'
