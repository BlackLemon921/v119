abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are among the most fundamental tools for
  binary classification. In its simplest formulation, an SVM produces a hyperplane
  separating two classes of data using the largest possible margin to the data. The
  focus on maximizing the margin has been well motivated through numerous generalization
  bounds. In this paper, we revisit and improve the classic generalization bounds
  in terms of margins. Furthermore, we complement our new generalization bound by
  a nearly matching lower bound, thus almost settling the generalization performance
  of SVMs in terms of margins.
