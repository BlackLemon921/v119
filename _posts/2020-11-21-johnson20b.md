abstract: This paper presents a framework of successive functional gradient optimization
  for training nonconvex models such as neural networks, where training is driven
  by mirror descent in a function space. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirical
  study of the training method derived from this framework. It is shown that the method
  leads to better performance than that of standard training techniques.
