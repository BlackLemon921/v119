abstract: We study the basic operation of set union in the global model of differential
  privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of infinite
  size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset $W_i \subseteq
  U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially private Algorithm which
  outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the size of $S$ is as large as
  possible. The problem arises in countless real world applications, and is particularly
  ubiquitous in natural language processing (NLP) applications. For example, discovering
  words, sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
  instance of the set union problem. In this paper we design new algorithms for this
  problem that significantly outperform the best known algorithms.
