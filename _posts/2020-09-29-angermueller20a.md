abstract: The use of black-box optimization for the design of new biological sequences
  is an emerging research area with potentially revolutionary impact. The cost and
  latency of wet-lab experiments requires methods that find good sequences in few
  experimental rounds of large batches of sequences â€” a setting that off-the-shelf
  black-box optimization methods are ill-equipped to handle. We find that the performance
  of existing methods varies drastically across optimization tasks, posing a significant
  obstacle to real-world applications. To improve robustness, we propose Population-Based
  Black-Box Optimization (P3BO), which generates batches of sequences by sampling
  from an ensemble of methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is
  proportional to the quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to
  combine the strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness.
  Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary optimization
  further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on in-silico optimization
  tasks, we show that P3BO outperforms any single method in its population, proposing
  higher quality sequences as well as more diverse batches. As such, P3BO and Adaptive-P3BO
  are a crucial step towards deploying ML to real-world sequence design.
