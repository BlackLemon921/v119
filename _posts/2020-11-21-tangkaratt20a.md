abstract: Learning from demonstrations can be challenging when the quality of demonstrations
  is diverse, and even more so when the quality is unknown and there is no additional
  information to estimate the quality. We propose a new method for imitation learning
  in such scenarios. We show that simple quality-estimation approaches might fail
  due to compounding error, and fix this issue by jointly estimating both the quality
  and reward using a variational approach. Our method is easy to implement within
  reinforcement-learning frameworks and also achieves state-of-the-art performance
  on continuous-control benchmarks.Our work enables scalable and data-efficient imitation
  learning under more realistic settings than before.
