abstract: 'We introduce Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework
  that combines deep learning with constraint reasoning for solving pattern de-mixing
  problems, typically in an unsupervised or very-weakly-supervised setting. DRNets
  exploit problem structure and prior knowledge by tightly combining constraint reasoning
  with stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization. Our motivating task
  is from materials discovery and concerns inferring crystal structures of materials
  from X-ray diffraction data (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). Given the complexity
  of its underlying scientific domain, we start by introducing DRNets on an analogous
  but much simpler task: de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku).
  On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets almost perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus’ digits,
  with 100% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing
  models. On Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, DRNets significantly outperform the
  state of the art and experts’ capabilities, recovering more precise and physically
  meaningful crystal structures.'
