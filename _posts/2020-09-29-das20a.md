abstract: Recent work has shown how predictive modeling can endow agents with rich
  knowledge of their surroundings, improving their ability to act in complex environments.
  We propose question-answering as a general paradigm to decode and understand the
  representations that such agents develop, applying our method to two recent approaches
  to predictive modelling - action-conditional CPC (Guo et al., 2018) and SimCore
  (Gregor et al., 2019). After training agents with these predictive objectives in
  a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of objects, colors, shapes, and
  spatial configurations, we probe their internal state representations with a host
  of synthetic (English) questions, without backpropagating gradients from the question-answering
  decoder into the agent. The performance of different agents when probed in this
  way reveals that they learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information
  about objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment.
  Our approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret the responses of the
  model as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e. applicable
  to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of objects, quantities,
  properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn, question-conditional
  agent probing can stimulate the design and development of stronger predictive learning
  objectives.
