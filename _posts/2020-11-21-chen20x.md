abstract: 'Models trained on synthetic images often face degraded generalization to
  real data. As a convention, these models are often initialized with ImageNet pretrained
  representation. Yet the role of ImageNet knowledge is seldom discussed despite common
  practices that leverage this knowledge to maintain the generalization ability. An
  example is the careful hand-tuning of early stopping and layer-wise learning rates,
  which is shown to improve synthetic-to-real generalization but is also laborious
  and heuristic. In this work, we explicitly encourage the synthetically trained model
  to maintain similar representations with the ImageNet pretrained model, and propose
  a \emph{learning-to-optimize (L2O)} strategy to automate the selection of layer-wise
  learning rates. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve
  the synthetic-to-real generalization performance without seeing and training on
  real data, while also benefiting downstream tasks such as domain adaptation. Code
