abstract: The Frank-Wolfe algorithm has become a popular first-order optimization
  algorithm for it is simple and projection-free, and it has been successfully applied
  to a variety of real-world problems. Its main drawback however lies in its convergence
  rate, which can be excessively slow due to naive descent directions. We propose
  to speed up the Frank-Wolfe algorithm by better aligning the descent direction with
  that of the negative gradient via a subroutine. This subroutine chases the negative
  gradient direction in a matching pursuit-style while still preserving the projection-free
  property. Although the approach is reasonably natural, it produces very significant
  results. We derive convergence rates $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\omega
  t})$ of our method and we demonstrate its competitive advantage both per iteration
  and in CPU time over the state-of-the-art in a series of computational experiments.
