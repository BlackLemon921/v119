abstract: Efficient exploration remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning,
  especially for those tasks where rewards from environments are sparse. In this work,
  we introduce an exploration approach based on a novel implicit generative modeling
  algorithm to estimate a Bayesian uncertainty of the agentâ€™s belief of the environment
  dynamics. Each random draw from our generative model is a neural network that instantiates
  the dynamic function, hence multiple draws would approximate the posterior, and
  the variance in the predictions based on this posterior is used as an intrinsic
  reward for exploration. We design a training algorithm for our generative model
  based on the amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent. In experiments, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of this exploration algorithm in both pure exploration tasks and
  a downstream task, comparing with state-of-the-art intrinsic reward-based exploration
  approaches, including two recent approaches based on an ensemble of dynamic models.
  In challenging exploration tasks, our implicit generative model consistently outperforms
  competing approaches regarding data efficiency in exploration.
