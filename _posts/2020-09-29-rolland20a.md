abstract: A well-known first-order method for sampling from log-concave probability
  distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a new
  annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence guarantees
  for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not covered by existing
  state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this result, we derive a new
  theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance to total variation distance
  between any two log-concave distributions that complements the reach of Talagrand
  $T_2$ inequality. Moreover, applying this new step size schedule to an existing
  constrained sampling algorithm, we show state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling
  from a constrained log-concave distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.
