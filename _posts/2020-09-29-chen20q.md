abstract: Despite remarkable success in practice, modern machine learning models have
  been found to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that make human-imperceptible
  perturbations to the data, but result in serious and potentially dangerous prediction
  errors. To address this issue, practitioners often use adversarial training to learn
  models that are robust against such attacks at the cost of higher generalization
  error on unperturbed test sets. The conventional wisdom is that more training data
  should shrink the gap between the generalization error of adversarially-trained
  models and standard models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers
  for both Gaussian and Bernoulli models under $\ell_\infty$ attacks, and we prove
  that more data may actually increase this gap. Furthermore, our theoretical results
  identify if and when additional data will finally begin to shrink the gap. Lastly,
  we experimentally demonstrate that our results also hold for linear regression models,
  which may indicate that this phenomenon occurs more broadly.
