abstract: Estimation of individual treatment effects is commonly used as the basis
  for contextual decision making in fields such as healthcare, education, and economics.
  However, it is often sufficient for the decision maker to have estimates of upper
  and lower bounds on the potential outcomes of decision alternatives to assess risks
  and benefits. We show that, in such cases, we can improve sample efficiency by estimating
  simple functions that bound these outcomes instead of estimating their conditional
  expectations, which may be complex and hard to estimate. Our analysis highlights
  a trade-off between the complexity of the learning task and the confidence with
  which the learned bounds hold. Guided by these findings, we develop an algorithm
  for learning upper and lower bounds on potential outcomes which optimize an objective
  function defined by the decision maker, subject to the probability that bounds are
  violated being small. Using a clinical dataset and a well-known causality benchmark,
  we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baselines, providing tighter, more
  reliable bounds.
