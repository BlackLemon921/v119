abstract: 'We seek to learn models that we can interact with using high-level concepts:
  if the model did not think there was a bone spur in the x-ray, would it still predict
  severe arthritis? State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation
  of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end to
  go directly from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity).
  We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training
  time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can
  intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept
  values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and
  bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with
  standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level
  clinical concepts ("bone spurs") or bird attributes ("wing color"). These models
  also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if
  we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.'
