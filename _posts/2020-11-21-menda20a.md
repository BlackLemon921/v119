abstract: System identification is a key step for model-based control, estimator design,
  and output prediction. This work considers the offline identification of partially
  observed nonlinear systems. We empirically show that the certainty-equivalent approximation
  to expectation-maximization can be a reliable and scalable approach for high-dimensional
  deterministic systems, which are common in robotics. We formulate certainty-equivalent
  expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation.
  The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating
  its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based
  approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter.
  By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts
  the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches. The
  codebase for this work is available at https://github.com/sisl/CEEM.
