abstract: 'Entropy regularization in optimal transport (OT) has been the driver of
  many recent interests for Wasserstein metrics and barycenters in machine learning.
  It allows to keep the appealing geometrical properties of the unregularized Wasserstein
  distance while having a significantly lower complexity thanks to Sinkhornâ€™s algorithm.
  However, entropy brings some inherent smoothing bias, resulting for example in blurred
  barycenters. This side effect has prompted an increasing temptation in the community
  to settle for a slower algorithm such as log-domain stabilized Sinkhorn which breaks
  the parallel structure that can be leveraged on GPUs, or even go back to unregularized
  OT. Here we show how this bias is tightly linked to the reference measure that defines
  the entropy regularizer and propose debiased Sinkhorn barycenters that preserve
  the best of worlds: fast Sinkhorn-like iterations without entropy smoothing. Theoretically,
  we prove that this debiasing is perfect for Gaussian distributions with equal variance.
  Empirically, we illustrate the reduced blurring and the computational advantage.'
