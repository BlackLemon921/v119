abstract: We aim to develop off-policy DRL algorithms that not only exceed state-of-the-art
  performance but are also simple and minimalistic. For standard continuous control
  benchmarks, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), which employs entropy maximization, currently
  provides state-of-the-art performance. We first demonstrate that the entropy term
  in SAC addresses action saturation due to the bounded nature of the action spaces,
  with this insight, we propose a streamlined algorithm with a simple normalization
  scheme or with inverted gradients. We show that both approaches can match SACâ€™s
  sample efficiency performance without the need of entropy maximization, we then
  propose a simple non-uniform sampling method for selecting transitions from the
  replay buffer during training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
  proposed sampling scheme leads to state of the art sample efficiency on challenging
  continuous control tasks. We combine all of our findings into one simple algorithm,
  which we call Streamlined Off Policy with Emphasizing Recent Experience, for which
  we provide robust public-domain code.
