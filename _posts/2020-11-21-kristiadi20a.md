abstract: The point estimates of ReLU classification networks—arguably the most widely
  used neural network architecture—have been shown to yield arbitrarily high confidence
  far away from the training data. This architecture, in conjunction with a maximum
  a posteriori estimation scheme, is thus not calibrated nor robust. Approximate Bayesian
  inference has been empirically demonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in
  neural networks, although the theoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations
  is limited. We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights
  of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore,
  we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these
  issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty
  on a ReLU network is “to be a bit Bayesian”. These theoretical results validate
  the usage of last-layer Bayesian approximation and motivate a range of a fidelity-cost
  trade-off. We further validate these findings empirically via various standard experiments
  using common deep ReLU networks and Laplace approximations.
