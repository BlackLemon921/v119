abstract: We present GradientDICE for estimating the density ratio between the state
  distribution of the target policy and the sampling distribution in off-policy reinforcement
  learning. GradientDICE fixes several problems of GenDICE (Zhang et al., 2020), the
  current state-of-the-art for estimating such density ratios. Namely, the optimization
  problem in GenDICE is not a convex-concave saddle-point problem once nonlinearity
  in optimization variable parameterization is introduced to ensure positivity, so
  primal-dual algorithms are not guaranteed to find the desired solution. However,
  such nonlinearity is essential to ensure the consistency of GenDICE even with a
  tabular representation. This is a fundamental contradiction, resulting from GenDICE’s
  original formulation of the optimization problem. In GradientDICE, we optimize a
  different objective from GenDICE by using the Perron-Frobenius theorem and eliminating
  GenDICE’s use of divergence, such that nonlinearity in parameterization is not necessary
  for GradientDICE, which is provably convergent under linear function approximation.
