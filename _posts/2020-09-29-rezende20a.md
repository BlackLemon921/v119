abstract: Normalizing flows are a powerful tool for building expressive distributions
  in high dimensions. So far, most of the literature has concentrated on learning
  flows on Euclidean spaces. Some problems however, such as those involving angles,
  are defined on spaces with more complex geometries, such as tori or spheres. In
  this paper, we propose and compare expressive and numerically stable flows on such
  spaces. Our flows are built recursively on the dimension of the space, starting
  from flows on circles, closed intervals or spheres.
