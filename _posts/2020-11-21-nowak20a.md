abstract: Max-margin methods for binary classification such as the support vector
  machine (SVM) have been extended to the structured prediction setting under the
  name of max-margin Markov networks ($M^3N$), or more generally structural SVMs.
  Unfortunately, these methods are statistically inconsistent when the relationship
  between inputs and labels is far from deterministic. We overcome such limitations
  by defining the learning problem in terms of a “max-min” margin formulation, naming
  the resulting method max-min margin Markov networks ($M^4N$). We prove consistency
  and finite sample generalization bounds for $M^4N$ and provide an explicit algorithm
  to compute the estimator. The algorithm achieves a generalization error of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
  for a total cost of $O(n)$ projection-oracle calls (which have at most the same
  cost as the max-oracle from $M^3N$). Experiments on multi-class classification,
  ordinal regression, sequence prediction and ranking demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
