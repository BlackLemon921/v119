abstract: Creating open-ended algorithms, which generate their own never-ending stream
  of novel and appropriately challenging learning opportunities, could help to automate
  and accelerate progress in machine learning. A recent step in this direction is
  the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves
  its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid
  local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative
  potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external
  issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure.
  Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit
  of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new
  innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed
  to help elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most
  open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1)
  a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling
  the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and
  (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one
  problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm
  itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce
  (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic
  measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation.
  Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide
  range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other
  means.
