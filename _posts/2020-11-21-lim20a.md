abstract: Entropy is ubiquitous in machine learning, but it is in general intractable
  to compute the entropy of the distribution of an arbitrary continuous random variable.
  In this paper, we propose the amortized residual denoising autoencoder (AR-DAE)
  to approximate the gradient of the log density function, which can be used to estimate
  the gradient of entropy. Amortization allows us to significantly reduce the error
  of the gradient approximator by approaching asymptotic optimality of a regular DAE,
  in which case the estimation is in theory unbiased. We conduct theoretical and experimental
  analyses on the approximation error of the proposed method, as well as extensive
  studies on heuristics to ensure its robustness. Finally, using the proposed gradient
  approximator to estimate the gradient of entropy, we demonstrate state-of-the-art
  performance on density estimation with variational autoencoders and continuous control
  with soft actor-critic.
