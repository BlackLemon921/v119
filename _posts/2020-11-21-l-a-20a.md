abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a widely used risk metric in applications
  such as finance. We derive concentration bounds for CVaR estimates, considering
  separately the cases of sub-Gaussian, light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions.
  For the sub-Gaussian and light-tailed cases, we use a classical CVaR estimator based
  on the empirical distribution constructed from the samples. For heavy-tailed random
  variables, we assume a mild ‘bounded moment’ condition, and derive a concentration
  bound for a truncation-based estimator. Our concentration bounds exhibit exponential
  decay in the sample size, and are tighter than those available in the literature
  for the above distribution classes. To demonstrate the applicability of our concentration
  results, we consider the CVaR optimization problem in a multi-armed bandit setting.
  Specifically, we address the best CVaR-arm identification problem under a fixed
  budget. Using our CVaR concentration results, we derive an upper-bound on the probability
  of incorrect arm identification.
