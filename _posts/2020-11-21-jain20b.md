abstract: A fundamental trait of intelligence is the ability to achieve goals in the
  face of novel circumstances, such as making decisions from new action choices. However,
  standard reinforcement learning assumes a fixed set of actions and requires expensive
  retraining when given a new action set. To make learning agents more adaptable,
  we introduce the problem of zero-shot generalization to new actions. We propose
  a two-stage framework where the agent first infers action representations from action
  information acquired separately from the task. A policy flexible to varying action
  sets is then trained with generalization objectives. We benchmark generalization
  on sequential tasks, such as selecting from an unseen tool-set to solve physical
  reasoning puzzles and stacking towers with novel 3D shapes. Videos and code are
