abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the curse of dimensionality
  when the state-action space is large. A common practice is to parameterize the high-dimensional
  value and policy functions using given features. However existing methods either
  have no theoretical guarantee or suffer a regret that is exponential in the planning
  horizon $H$.In this paper, we propose an online RL algorithm, namely the MatrixRL,
  that leverages ideas from linear bandit to learn a low-dimensional representation
  of the probability transition model while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration
  tradeoff. We show that MatrixRL achieves a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2d\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$
  where $d$ is the number of features, independent with the number of state-action
  pairs. MatrixRL has an equivalent kernelized version, which is able to work with
  an arbitrary kernel Hilbert space without using explicit features. In this case,
  the kernelized MatrixRL satisfies a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2\wt{d}\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$,
  where $\wt{d}$ is the effective dimension of the kernel space.
