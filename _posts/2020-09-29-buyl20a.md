abstract: 'As machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed for high-impact
  automated decision making, ethical and increasingly also legal standards demand
  that they treat all individuals fairly, without discrimination based on their age,
  gender, race or other sensitive traits. In recent years much progress has been made
  on ensuring fairness and reducing bias in standard machine learning settings. Yet,
  for network embedding, with applications in vulnerable domains ranging from social
  network analysis to recommender systems, current options remain limited both in
  number and performance. We thus propose DeBayes: a conceptually elegant Bayesian
  method that is capable of learning debiased embeddings by using a biased prior.
  Our experiments show that these representations can then be used to perform link
  prediction that is significantly more fair in terms of popular metrics such as demographic
  parity and equalized opportunity.'
