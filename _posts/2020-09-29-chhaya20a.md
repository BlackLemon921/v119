abstract: 'Factorizing tensors has recently become an important optimization module
  in a number of machine learning pipelines, especially in latent variable models.
  We show how to do this efficiently in the streaming setting. Given a set of $n$
  vectors, each in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we present algorithms to select a sublinear number
  of these vectors as coreset, while guaranteeing that the CP decomposition of the
  $p$-moment tensor of the coreset approximates the corresponding decomposition of
  the $p$-moment tensor computed from the full data. We introduce two novel algorithmic
  techniques: online filtering and kernelization. Using these two, we present four
  algorithms that achieve different tradeoffs of coreset size, update time and working
  space, beating or matching various state of the art algorithms. In the case of matrices
  (2-ordered tensor), our online row sampling algorithm guarantees $(1 \pm \epsilon)$
  relative error spectral approximation. We show applications of our algorithms in
  learning single topic modeling.'
