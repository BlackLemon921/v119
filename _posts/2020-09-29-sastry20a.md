abstract: When presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, deep neural networks
  yield confident, incorrect predictions; detecting OOD examples is challenging, and
  the potential risks are high. In this paper, we propose to detect OOD examples by
  identifying inconsistencies between activity patterns and predicted class. We find
  that characterizing activity patterns by Gram matrices and identifying anomalies
  in Gram matrix values can yield high OOD detection rates. We identify anomalies
  in the Gram matrices by simply comparing each value with its respective range observed
  over the training data. Unlike many approaches, this can be used with any pre-trained
  softmax classifier and neither requires access to OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters,
  nor does it require OOD access for inferring parameters. We empirically demonstrate
  applicability across a variety of architectures and vision datasets and, for the
  important and surprisingly hard task of detecting far out-of-distribution examples,
  it generally performs better than or equal to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods
  (including those that do assume access to OOD examples).
