abstract: 'We provide a new online learning algorithm that for the first time combines
  several disparate notions of adaptivity. First, our algorithm obtains a “parameter-free”
  regret bound that adapts to the norm of the comparator and the squared norm of the
  size of the gradients it observes. Second, it obtains a “strongly-adaptive” regret
  bound, so that for any given interval of length $N$, the regret over the interval
  is $\tilde O(\sqrt{N})$. Finally, our algorithm obtains an optimal “dynamic” regret
  bound: for any sequence of comparators with path-length $P$, our algorithm obtains
  regret $\tilde O(\sqrt{PN})$ over intervals of length $N$. Our primary technique
  for achieving these goals is a new method of combining constrained online learning
  regret bounds that does not rely on an expert meta-algorithm to aggregate learners.'
