abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using a fixed offline dataset of
  logged interactions is an important consideration in real world applications. This
  paper studies offline RL using the DQN replay dataset comprising the entire replay
  experience of a DQN agent on 60 Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that recent off-policy
  deep RL algorithms, even when trained solely on this fixed dataset, outperform the
  fully trained DQN agent. To enhance generalization in the offline setting, we present
  Random Ensemble Mixture (REM), a robust Q-learning algorithm that enforces optimal
  Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of multiple Q-value estimates.
  Offline REM trained on the DQN replay dataset surpasses strong RL baselines. Ablation
  studies highlight the role of offline dataset size and diversity as well as the
  algorithm choice in our positive results. Overall, the results here present an optimistic
  view that robust RL algorithms trained on sufficiently large and diverse offline
  datasets can lead to high quality policies. The DQN replay dataset can serve as
  an offline RL benchmark and is open-sourced.
