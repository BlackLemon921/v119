abstract: 'How can multiple distributed entities train a shared deep net on their
  private data while protecting data privacy? This paper introduces InstaHide, a simple
  encryption of training images. Encrypted images can be used in standard deep learning
  pipelines (PyTorch, Federated Learning etc.) with no additional setup or infrastructure.
  The encryption has a minor effect on test accuracy (unlike differential privacy).
  Encryption consists of mixing the image with a set of other images (in the sense
  of Mixup data augmentation technique (Zhang et al., 2018)) followed by applying
  a random pixel-wise mask on the mixed image. Other contributions of this paper are:
  (a) Use of large public dataset of images (e.g. ImageNet) for mixing during encryption;
  this improves security. (b) Experiments demonstrating effectiveness in protecting
  privacy against known attacks while preserving model accuracy. (c) Theoretical analysis
  showing that successfully attacking privacy requires attackers to solve a difficult
  computational problem. (d) Demonstration that Mixup alone is insecure as (contrary
  to recent proposals), by showing some efficient attacks. (e) Release of a challenge
  dataset to allow design of new attacks.'
