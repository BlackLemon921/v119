abstract: 'Reinforcement learning allows solving complex tasks, however, the learning
  tends to be task-specific and the sample efficiency remains a challenge. We present
  Plan2Explore, a self-supervised reinforcement learning agent that tackles both these
  challenges through a new approach to self-supervised exploration and fast adaptation
  to new tasks, which need not be known during exploration. During exploration, unlike
  prior methods which retrospectively compute the novelty of observations after the
  agent has already reached them, our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning
  to seek out expected future novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts
  to multiple downstream tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging
  control tasks from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision
  or task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised exploration
  methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which has access to
  rewards. Videos and code: https://ramanans1.github.io/plan2explore/'
