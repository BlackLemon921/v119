abstract: The reproducibility debate has caused a renewed interest in changing how
  one reports uncertainty, from $p$-value for testing a null hypothesis to a confidence
  interval (CI) for the corresponding parameter. When CIs for multiple selected parameters
  are being reported, the analog of the false discovery rate (FDR) is the false coverage
  rate (FCR), which is the expected ratio of number of reported CIs failing to cover
  their respective parameters to the total number of reported CIs. Here, we consider
  the general problem of FCR control in the online setting, where one encounters an
  infinite sequence of fixed unknown parameters ordered by time. We propose a novel
  solution to the problem which only requires the scientist to be able to construct
  marginal CIs. As special cases, our framework yields algorithms for online FDR control
  and online sign-classification procedures that control the false sign rate (FSR).
  All of our methodology applies equally well to prediction intervals, having particular
  implications for selective conformal inference.
