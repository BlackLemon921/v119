abstract: 'We propose new multi-input shape constraints across four intuitive categories:
  complements, diminishers, dominance, and unimodality constraints. We show these
  shape constraints can be checked and even enforced when training machine-learned
  models for linear models, generalized additive models, and the nonlinear function
  class of multi-layer lattice models. Real-world experiments illustrate how the different
  shape constraints can be used to increase explainability and improve regularization,
  especially for non-IID train-test distribution shift.'
