abstract: We consider a new unsupervised learning task of inferring parameters of
  a multiobjective decision making model, based on a set of observed decisions from
  the human expert. This setting is important in applications (such as the task of
  portfolio management) where it may be difficult to obtain the human expertâ€™s intrinsic
  decision making model. We formulate such a learning problem as an inverse multiobjective
  optimization problem (IMOP) and propose its first sophisticated model with statistical
  guarantees. Then, we reveal several fundamental connections between IMOP, K-means
  clustering, and manifold learning. Leveraging these critical insights and connections,
  we propose two algorithms to solve IMOP through manifold learning and clustering.
  Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our model and the computational efficacy
  of algorithms.
