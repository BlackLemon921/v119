abstract: We consider distributions arising from a mixture of causal models, where
  each model is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We provide a graphical
  representation of such mixture distributions and prove that this representation
  encodes the conditional independence relations of the mixture distribution. We then
  consider the problem of structure learning based on samples from such distributions.
  Since the mixing variable is latent, we consider causal structure discovery algorithms
  such as FCI that can deal with latent variables. We show that such algorithms recover
  a “union” of the component DAGs and can identify variables whose conditional distribution
  across the component DAGs vary. We demonstrate our results on synthetic and real
  data showing that the inferred graph identifies nodes that vary between the different
  mixture components. As an immediate application, we demonstrate how retrieval of
  this causal information can be used to cluster samples according to each mixture
  component.
