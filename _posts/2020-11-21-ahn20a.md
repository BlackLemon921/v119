abstract: 'Designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization appears ubiquitously
  in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks
  have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automate the design
  of a solver while relying less on sophisticated domain knowledge of the target problem.
  However, the existing DRL solvers determine the solution using a number of stages
  proportional to the number of elements in the solution, which severely limits their
  applicability to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue
  by proposing a novel DRL scheme, coined learning what to defer (LwD), where the
  agent adaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to distribute
  the element-wise decisions of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed
  framework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its significant
  improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also show that LwD
  can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs having millions
  of vertices, under a limited time budget.'
