abstract: In this paper, we propose a new randomized second-order optimization algorithm—Stochastic
  Subspace Cubic Newton (SSCN)—for minimizing a high dimensional convex function $f$.
  Our method can be seen both as a \emph{stochastic} extension of the cubically-regularized
  Newton method of Nesterov and Polyak (2006), and a \emph{second-order} enhancement
  of stochastic subspace descent of Kozak et al. (2019). We prove that as we vary
  the minibatch size, the global convergence rate of SSCN interpolates between the
  rate of stochastic coordinate descent (CD) and the rate of cubic regularized Newton,
  thus giving new insights into the connection between first and second-order methods.
  Remarkably, the local convergence rate of SSCN matches the rate of stochastic subspace
  descent applied to the problem of minimizing the quadratic function $\frac12 (x-x^*)^\top
  \nabla^2f(x^*)(x-x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the minimizer of $f$, and hence depends on
  the properties of $f$ at the optimum only. Our numerical experiments show that SSCN
  outperforms non-accelerated first-order CD algorithms while being competitive to
  their accelerated variants.
