abstract: In many real-world applications, data are collected in the form of a stream,
  whose feature space can evolve over time. For instance, in the environmental monitoring
  task, features can be dynamically vanished or augmented due to the existence of
  expired old sensors and deployed new sensors. Furthermore, besides the evolvable
  feature space, the data distribution is usually changing in the streaming scenario.
  When both feature space and data distribution are evolvable, it is quite challenging
  to design algorithms with guarantees, particularly theoretical understandings of
  generalization ability. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel discrepancy
  measure for data with evolving feature space and data distribution, named the \emph{evolving
  discrepancy}. Based on that, we present the generalization error analysis, and the
  theory motivates the design of a learning algorithm which is further implemented
  by deep neural networks. Empirical studies on synthetic data verify the rationale
  of our proposed discrepancy measure, and extensive experiments on real-world tasks
  validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
