abstract: We study the problem of learning from multiple untrusted data sources, a
  scenario of increasing practical relevance given the recent emergence of crowdsourcing
  and collaborative learning paradigms. Specifically, we analyze the situation in
  which a learning system obtains datasets from multiple sources, some of which might
  be biased or even adversarially perturbed. It is known that in the single-source
  case, an adversary with the power to corrupt a fixed fraction of the training data
  can prevent PAC-learnability, that is, even in the limit of infinitely much training
  data, no learning system can approach the optimal test error. In this work we show
  that, surprisingly, the same is not true in the multi-source setting, where the
  adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a fixed fraction of the data sources. Our main
  results are a generalization bound that provides finite-sample guarantees for this
  learning setting, as well as corresponding lower bounds. Besides establishing PAC-learnability
  our results also show that in a cooperative learning setting sharing data with other
  parties has provable benefits, even if some participants are malicious.
