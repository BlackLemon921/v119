abstract: Deep autoregressive models compute point likelihood estimates of individual
  data points. However, many applications (i.e., database cardinality estimation),
  require estimating range densities, a capability that is under-explored by current
  neural density estimation literature. In these applications, fast and accurate range
  density estimates over high-dimensional data directly impact user-perceived performance.
  In this paper, we explore a technique for accelerating range density estimation
  over deep autoregressive models. This technique, called variable skipping, exploits
  the sparse structure of range density queries to avoid sampling unnecessary variables
  during approximate inference. We show that variable skipping provides 10-100x efficiency
  improvements when targeting challenging high-quantile error metrics, enables complex
  applications such as text pattern matching, and can be realized via a simple data
  augmentation procedure without changing the usual maximum likelihood objective.
