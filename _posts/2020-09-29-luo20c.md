abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has become an increasingly important
  research topic in machine learning. Despite all the practical success, most of existing
  NMF models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To overcome this limitation,
  we propose a novel Adversarial NMF (ANMF) approach in which an adversary can exercise
  some control over the perturbed data generation process. Different from the traditional
  NMF models which focus on either the regular input or certain types of noise, our
  model considers potential test adversaries that are beyond the pre-defined constraints,
  which can cope with various noises (or perturbations). We formulate the proposed
  model as a bilevel optimization problem and use Alternating Direction Method of
  Multipliers (ADMM) to solve it with convergence analysis. Theoretically, the robustness
  analysis of ANMF is established under mild conditions dedicating asymptotically
  unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments verify that ANMF is robust to a broad
  categories of perturbations, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on distinct
  real-world benchmark datasets.
