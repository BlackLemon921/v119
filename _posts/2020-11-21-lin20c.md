abstract: We study the properties of a leave-node-out jackknife procedure for network
  data. Under the sparse graphon model, we prove an Efron-Stein-type inequality, showing
  that the network jackknife leads to conservative estimates of the variance (in expectation)
  for any network functional that is invariant to node permutation. For a general
  class of count functionals, we also establish consistency of the network jackknife.
  We complement our theoretical analysis with a range of simulated and real-data examples
  and show that the network jackknife offers competitive performance in cases where
  other resampling methods are known to be valid. In fact, for several network statistics,
  we see that the jackknife provides more accurate inferences compared to related
  methods such as subsampling.
