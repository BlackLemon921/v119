abstract: 'Unlabeled linear regression, or “linear regression with an unknown permutation”,
  has attracted increasing attentions due to its applications in (e.g.,) linkage record
  and de-anonymization. However, the computation of unlabeled linear regression proves
  to be cumbersome and existing algorithms typically require considerable time, especially
  in the high dimensional regime. In this paper, we propose a one-step estimator which
  is optimal from both the computational and the statistical aspects. From the computational
  perspective, our estimator exhibits the same order of computational complexity as
  that of the oracle case (which means the regression coefficients are known in advance
  and only the permutation needs recovery). From the statistical perspective, when
  comparing with the necessary conditions for permutation recovery, our requirement
  on the \emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\mathsf{SNR}$) agrees up to merely $\Omega\left(\log
  \log n\right)$ difference when the stable rank of the regression coefficients $\ensuremath{\mathbf{B}}^{\natural}$
  is much less than $\log n/\log \log n$. '
