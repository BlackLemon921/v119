abstract: In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm for regression problems called
  \emph{boosted histogram transform for regression} (BHTR) based on histogram transforms
  composed of random rotations, stretchings, and translations. From the theoretical
  perspective, we first prove fast convergence rates for BHTR under the assumption
  that the target function lies in the spaces $C^{0,\alpha}$. Moreover, if the target
  function resides in the subspace $C^{1,\alpha}$, by establishing the upper bound
  of the convergence rate for the boosted regressor, i.e. BHTR, and the lower bound
  for base regressors, i.e. histogram transform regressors (HTR), we manage to explain
  the benefits of the boosting procedure. In the experiments, compared with other
  state-of-the-art algorithms such as gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), Breimanâ€™s
  forest, and kernel-based methods, our BHTR algorithm shows promising performance
  on both synthetic and real datasets.
