abstract: We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the
  input space in latent representations of autoencoders. Using persistent homology,
  a technique from topological data analysis, we calculate topological signatures
  of both the input and latent space to derive a topological loss term. Under weak
  theoretical assumptions, we construct this loss in a differentiable manner, such
  that the encoding learns to retain multi-scale connectivity information. We show
  that our approach is theoretically well-founded and that it exhibits favourable
  latent representations on a synthetic manifold as well as on real-world image data
  sets, while preserving low reconstruction errors.
