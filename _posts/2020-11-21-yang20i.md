abstract: Centralized training with decentralized execution has become an important
  paradigm in multi-agent learning. Though practical, current methods rely on restrictive
  assumptions to decompose the centralized value function across agents for execution.
  In this paper, we eliminate this restriction by proposing multi-agent determinantal
  Q-learning. Our method is established on Q-DPP, a novel extension of determinantal
  point process (DPP) to multi-agent setting. Q-DPP promotes agents to acquire diverse
  behavioral models; this allows a natural factorization of the joint Q-functions
  with no need for \emph{a priori} structural constraints on the value function or
  special network architectures. We demonstrate that Q-DPP generalizes major solutions
  including VDN, QMIX, and QTRAN on decentralizable cooperative tasks. To efficiently
  draw samples from Q-DPP, we develop a linear-time sampler with theoretical approximation
  guarantee. Our sampler also benefits exploration by coordinating agents to cover
  orthogonal directions in the state space during training. We evaluate our algorithm
  on multiple cooperative benchmarks; its effectiveness has been demonstrated when
  compared with the state-of-the-art.
