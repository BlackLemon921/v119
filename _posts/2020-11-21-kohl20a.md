abstract: We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and generalizing
  metric (LSiM) to compare data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. We
  focus on scalar time-dependent 2D data that commonly arises from motion and transport-based
  partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method employs a Siamese network architecture
  that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a controllable
  data generation setup with PDE solvers to create increasingly different outputs
  from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of
  our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about
  the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate
  that the proposed approach outperforms existing metrics for vector spaces and other
  learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range
  of test data. Additionally, we analyze generalization benefits of an adjustable
  training data difficulty and demonstrate the robustness of LSiM via an evaluation
  on three real-world data sets.
