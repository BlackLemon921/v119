abstract: Structured predictors require solving a combinatorial optimization problem
  over a large number of structures, such as dependency trees or alignments. When
  embedded as structured hidden layers in a neural net, argmin differentiation and
  efficient gradient computation are further required. Recently, SparseMAP has been
  proposed as a differentiable, sparse alternative to maximum a posteriori (MAP) and
  marginal inference. SparseMAP returns an interpretable combination of a small number
  of structures; its sparsity being the key to efficient optimization. However, SparseMAP
  requires access to an exact MAP oracle in the structured model, excluding, e.g.,
  loopy graphical models or logic constraints, which generally require approximate
  inference. In this paper, we introduce LP-SparseMAP, an extension of SparseMAP addressing
  this limitation via a local polytope relaxation. LP-SparseMAP uses the flexible
  and powerful language of factor graphs to define expressive hidden structures, supporting
  coarse decompositions, hard logic constraints, and higher-order correlations. We
  derive the forward and backward algorithms needed for using LP-SparseMAP as a structured
  hidden or output layer. Experiments in three structured tasks show benefits versus
  SparseMAP and Structured SVM.
