abstract: 'We propose a new framework for designing estimators for off-policy evaluation
  in contextual bandits. Our approach is based on the asymptotically optimal doubly
  robust estimator, but we shrink the importance weights to minimize a bound on the
  mean squared error, which results in a better bias-variance tradeoff in finite samples.
  We use this optimization-based framework to obtain three estimators: (a) a weight-clipping
  estimator, (b) a new weight-shrinkage estimator, and (c) the first shrinkage-based
  estimator for combinatorial action sets. Extensive experiments in both standard
  and combinatorial bandit benchmark problems show that our estimators are highly
  adaptive and typically outperform state-of-the-art methods.'
