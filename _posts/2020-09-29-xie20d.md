abstract: This paper studies the lower bound complexity for minimax optimization problem
  whose objective function is the average of $n$ individual smooth convex-concave
  functions. We consider the algorithm which gets access to gradient and proximal
  oracle for each individual component. For the strongly-convex-strongly-concave case,
  we prove such an algorithm can not reach an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal point in fewer
  than $\Omega\left((n+\kappa)\log(1/\varepsilon)\right)$ iterations, where $\kappa$
  is the condition number of the objective function. This lower bound matches the
  upper bound of the existing incremental first-order oracle algorithm stochastic
  variance-reduced extragradient. We develop a novel construction to show the above
  result, which partitions the tridiagonal matrix of classical examples into $n$ groups.
  This construction is friendly to the analysis of incremental gradient and proximal
  oracle and we also extend the analysis to general convex-concave cases.
