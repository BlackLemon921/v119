abstract: We introduce a randomly extrapolated primal-dual coordinate descent method
  that adapts to sparsity of the data matrix and the favorable structures of the objective
  function. Our method updates only a subset of primal and dual variables with sparse
  data, and it uses large step sizes with dense data, retaining the benefits of the
  specific methods designed for each case. In addition to adapting to sparsity, our
  method attains fast convergence guarantees in favorable cases \emph{without any
  modifications}. In particular, we prove linear convergence under metric subregularity,
  which applies to strongly convex-strongly concave problems and piecewise linear
  quadratic functions. We show almost sure convergence of the sequence and optimal
  sublinear convergence rates for the primal-dual gap and objective values, in the
  general convex-concave case. Numerical evidence demonstrates the state-of-the-art
  empirical performance of our method in sparse and dense settings, matching and improving
  the existing methods.
