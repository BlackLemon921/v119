abstract: Feature maps contain rich information about image intensity and spatial
  correlation. However, previous online knowledge distillation methods only utilize
  the class probabilities. Thus in this paper, we propose an online knowledge distillation
  method that transfers not only the knowledge of the class probabilities but also
  that of the feature map using the adversarial training framework. We train multiple
  networks simultaneously by employing discriminators to distinguish the feature map
  distributions of different networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator
  which discriminates the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that
  of the other network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator,
  it can learn the other networkâ€™s feature map distribution. We show that our method
  performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1 and is
  more suitable for online distillation. Also, we propose a novel cyclic learning
  scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied our method
  to various network architectures on the classification task and discovered a significant
  improvement of performance especially in the case of training a pair of a small
  network and a large one.
