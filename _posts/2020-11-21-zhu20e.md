abstract: Training machine learning models that are robust against adversarial inputs
  poses seemingly insurmountable challenges. To better understand adversarial robustness,
  we consider the underlying problem of learning robust representations. We develop
  a notion of representation vulnerability that captures the maximum change of mutual
  information between the input and output distributions, under the worst-case input
  perturbation. Then, we prove a theorem that establishes a lower bound on the minimum
  adversarial risk that can be achieved for any downstream classifier based on its
  representation vulnerability. We propose an unsupervised learning method for obtaining
  intrinsically robust representations by maximizing the worst-case mutual information
  between the input and output distributions. Experiments on downstream classification
  tasks support the robustness of the representations found using unsupervised learning
  with our training principle.
