abstract: A well-documented weakness of neural networks is the fact that they suffer
  from catastrophic forgetting when trained on data provided by a non-stationary distribution.
  Recent work in the field of continual learning attempts to understand and overcome
  this issue. Unfortunately, the majority of relevant work embraces the implicit assumption
  that the distribution of observed data is perfectly balanced, despite the fact that,
  in the real world, humans and animals learn from observations that are temporally
  correlated and severely imbalanced. Motivated by this remark, we aim to evaluate
  memory population methods that are used in online continual learning, when dealing
  with highly imbalanced and temporally correlated streams of data. More importantly,
  we introduce a new memory population approach, which we call class-balancing reservoir
  sampling (CBRS). We demonstrate that CBRS outperforms the state-of-the-art memory
  population algorithms in a considerably challenging learning setting, over a range
  of different datasets, and for multiple architectures.
