abstract: We revisit the optimization from samples (OPS) model, which studies the
  problem of optimizing objective functions directly from the sample data. Previous
  results showed that we cannot obtain a constant approximation ratio for the maximum
  coverage problem using polynomially many independent samples of the form $\{S_i,
  f(S_i)\}_{i=1}^t$ (Balkanski et al., 2017), even if coverage functions are $(1 -
  \epsilon)$-PMAC learnable using these samples (Badanidiyuru et al., 2012), which
  means most of the function values can be approximately learned very well with high
  probability. In this work, to circumvent the impossibility result of OPS, we propose
  a stronger model called optimization from structured samples (OPSS) for coverage
  functions, where the data samples encode the structural information of the functions.
  We show that under three general assumptions on the sample distributions, we can
  design efficient OPSS algorithms that achieve a constant approximation for the maximum
  coverage problem. We further prove a constant lower bound under these assumptions,
  which is tight when not considering computational efficiency. Moreover, we also
  show that if we remove any one of the three assumptions, OPSS for the maximum coverage
  problem has no constant approximation.
