abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the stationary distribution of
  an ergodic Markov chain given a set of sampled transitions. Classical simulation-based
  approaches assume access to the underlying process so that trajectories of sufficient
  length can be gathered to approximate stationary sampling. Instead, we consider
  an alternative setting where a \emph{fixed} set of transitions has been collected
  beforehand, by a separate, possibly unknown procedure. The goal is still to estimate
  properties of the stationary distribution, but without additional access to the
  underlying system. We propose a consistent estimator that is based on recovering
  a correction ratio function over the given data. In particular, we develop a variational
  power method (VPM) that provides provably consistent estimates under general conditions.
  In addition to unifying a number of existing approaches from different subfields,
  we also find that VPM yields significantly better estimates across a range of problems,
  including queueing, stochastic differential equations, post-processing MCMC, and
  off-policy evaluation.
