abstract: Simplex-valued data appear throughout statistics and machine learning, for
  example in the context of transfer learning and compression of deep networks. Existing
  models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related
  loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a
  number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use
  of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations
  by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued
  data {â€“} the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization
  of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other
  typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic
  loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical
  simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we
  introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization
  trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous
  categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study,
  an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task.
