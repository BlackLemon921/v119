abstract: Heretofore, neural networks with external memory are restricted to single
  memory with lossy representations of memory interactions. A rich representation
  of relationships between memory pieces urges a high-order and segregated relational
  memory. In this paper, we propose to separate the storage of individual experiences
  (item memory) and their occurring relationships (relational memory). The idea is
  implemented through a novel Self-attentive Associative Memory (SAM) operator. Found
  upon outer product, SAM forms a set of associative memories that represent the hypothetical
  high-order relationships between arbitrary pairs of memory elements, through which
  a relational memory is constructed from an item memory. The two memories are wired
  into a single sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning.
  We achieve competitive results with our proposed two-memory model in a diversity
  of machine learning tasks, from challenging synthetic problems to practical testbeds
  such as geometry, graph, reinforcement learning, and question answering.
