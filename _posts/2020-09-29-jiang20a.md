abstract: We address the problem of training models with black-box and hard-to-optimize
  metrics by expressing the metric as a monotonic function of a small number of easy-to-optimize
  surrogates. We pose the training problem as an optimization over a relaxed surrogate
  space, which we solve by estimating local gradients for the metric and performing
  inexact convex projections. We analyze gradient estimates based on finite differences
  and local linear interpolations, and show convergence of our approach under smoothness
  assumptions with respect to the surrogates. Experimental results on classification
  and ranking problems verify the proposal performs on par with methods that know
  the mathematical formulation, and adds notable value when the form of the metric
  is unknown.
