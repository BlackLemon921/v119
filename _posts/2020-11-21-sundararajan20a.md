abstract: The attribution problem, that is the problem of attributing a model’s prediction
  to its base features, is well-studied. We extend the notion of attribution to also
  apply to feature interactions. The Shapley value is a commonly used method to attribute
  a model’s prediction to its base features. We propose a generalization of the Shapley
  value called Shapley-Taylor index that attributes the model’s prediction to interactions
  of subsets of features up to some size $k$. The method is analogous to how the truncated
  Taylor Series decomposes the function value at a certain point using its derivatives
  at a different point. In fact, we show that the Shapley Taylor index is equal to
  the Taylor Series of the multilinear extension of the set-theoretic behavior of
  the model. We axiomatize this method using the standard Shapley axioms—linearity,
  dummy, symmetry and efficiency—and an additional axiom that we call the interaction
  distribution axiom. This new axiom explicitly characterizes how interactions are
  distributed for a class of functions that model pure interaction. We contrast the
  Shapley-Taylor index against the previously proposed Shapley Interaction index from
  the cooperative game theory literature. We also apply the Shapley Taylor index to
  three models and identify interesting qualitative insights.
