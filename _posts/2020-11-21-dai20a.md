abstract: This paper presents a recursive reasoning formalism of Bayesian optimization
  (BO) to model the reasoning process in the interactions between boundedly rational,
  self-interested agents with unknown, complex, and costly-to-evaluate payoff functions
  in repeated games, which we call Recursive Reasoning-Based BO (R2-B2). Our R2-B2
  algorithm is general in that it does not constrain the relationship among the payoff
  functions of different agents and can thus be applied to various types of games
  such as constant-sum, general-sum, and common-payoff games. We prove that by reasoning
  at level 2 or more and at one level higher than the other agents, our R2-B2 agent
  can achieve faster asymptotic convergence to no regret than that without utilizing
  recursive reasoning. We also propose a computationally cheaper variant of R2-B2
  called R2-B2-Lite at the expense of a weaker convergence guarantee. The performance
  and generality of our R2-B2 algorithm are empirically demonstrated using synthetic
  games, adversarial machine learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
