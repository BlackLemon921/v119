abstract: The high sample complexity of reinforcement learning challenges its use
  in practice. A promising approach is to quickly adapt pre-trained policies to new
  environments. Existing methods for this policy adaptation problem typically rely
  on domain randomization and meta-learning, by sampling from some distribution of
  target environments during pre-training, and thus face difficulty on out-of-distribution
  target environments. We propose new model-based mechanisms that are able to make
  online adaptation in unseen target environments, by combining ideas from no-regret
  online learning and adaptive control. We prove that the approach learns policies
  in the target environment that can quickly recover trajectories from the source
  environment, and establish the rate of convergence in general settings. We demonstrate
  the benefits of our approach for policy adaptation in a diverse set of continuous
  control tasks, achieving the performance of state-of-the-art methods with much lower
  sample complexity. Our project website, including code, can be found at https://yudasong.github.io/PADA.
