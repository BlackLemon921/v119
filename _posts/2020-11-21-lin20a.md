abstract: We consider nonconvex-concave minimax problems, $\min_{\mathbf{x}} \max_{\mathbf{y}
  \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$, where $f$ is nonconvex in $\mathbf{x}$
  but concave in $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ is a convex and bounded set. One of
  the most popular algorithms for solving this problem is the celebrated gradient
  descent ascent (GDA) algorithm, which has been widely used in machine learning,
  control theory and economics. Despite the extensive convergence results for the
  convex-concave setting, GDA with equal stepsize can converge to limit cycles or
  even diverge in a general setting. In this paper, we present the complexity results
  on two-time-scale GDA for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems, showing that
  the algorithm can find a stationary point of the function $\Phi(\cdot) := \max_{\mathbf{y}
  \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\cdot, \mathbf{y})$ efficiently. To the best our knowledge, this
  is the first nonasymptotic analysis for two-time-scale GDA in this setting, shedding
  light on its superior practical performance in training generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) and other real applications.
