abstract: 'We consider the task of learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision
  processes with an unknown transition function, bandit feedback, and adversarial
  losses. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(L|X|\sqrt{|A|T})$
  regret with high probability, where $L$ is the horizon, $|X|$ the number of states,
  $|A|$ the number of actions, and T the number of episodes. To our knowledge, our
  algorithm is the first to ensure $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in this
  challenging setting; in fact, it achieves the same regret as (Rosenberg & Mansour,
  2019a) who consider the easier setting with full-information. Our key contributions
  are two-fold: a tighter confidence set for the transition function; and an optimistic
  loss estimator that is inversely weighted by an "upper occupancy bound".'
