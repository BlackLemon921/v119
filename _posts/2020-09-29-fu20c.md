abstract: 'Recent years have witnessed intensive research interests on training deep
  neural networks (DNNs) more efficiently by quantization-based compression methods,
  which facilitate DNNs training in two ways: (1) activations are quantized to shrink
  the memory consumption, and (2) gradients are quantized to decrease the communication
  cost. However, existing methods mostly use a uniform mechanism that quantizes the
  values evenly. Such a scheme may cause a large quantization variance and slow down
  the convergence in practice. In this work, we introduce TinyScript, which applies
  a non-uniform quantization algorithm to both activations and gradients. TinyScript
  models the original values by a family of Weibull distributions and searches for
  ”quantization knobs” that minimize quantization variance. We also discuss the convergence
  of the non-uniform quantization algorithm on DNNs with varying depths, shedding
  light on the number of bits required for convergence. Experiments show that TinyScript
  always obtains lower quantization variance, and achieves comparable model qualities
  against full precision training using 1-2 bits less than the uniform-based counterpart.'
