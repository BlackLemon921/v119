abstract: A dynamic treatment regime (DTR) consists of a sequence of decision rules,
  one per stage of intervention, that dictates how to determine the treatment assignment
  to patients based on evolving treatments and covariatesâ€™ history. These regimes
  are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of
  the critical ingredients underlying more personalized decision-making systems. All
  reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal DTR in online settings
  will suffer O(\sqrt{|D_{X, S}|T}) regret on some environments, where T is the number
  of experiments, and D_{X, S} is the domains of treatments X and covariates S. This
  implies T = O (|D_{X, S}|) trials to generate an optimal DTR. In many applications,
  domains of X and S could be so enormous that the time required to ensure appropriate
  learning may be unattainable. We show that, if the causal diagram of the underlying
  environment is provided, one could achieve regret that is exponentially smaller
  than D_{X, S}. In particular, we develop two online algorithms that satisfy such
  regret bounds by exploiting the causal structure underlying the DTR; one is based
  on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU-DTR), and the other
  uses the posterior sampling learning (PS-DTR). Finally, we introduce efficient methods
  to accelerate these online learning procedures by leveraging the abundant, yet biased
  observational (non-experimental) data.
