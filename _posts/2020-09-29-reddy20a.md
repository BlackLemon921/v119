abstract: We seek to align agent behavior with a user’s objectives in a reinforcement
  learning setting with unknown dynamics, an unknown reward function, and unknown
  unsafe states. The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user
  is expensive. We propose an algorithm that safely and efficiently learns a model
  of the user’s reward function by posing ’what if?’ questions about hypothetical
  agent behavior. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward
  dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize
  hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains
  a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize
  the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the
  value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method
  reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST
  with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car
  Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior
  methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different
  initial state distributions. Moreover, ReQueST safely trains the reward model to
  detect unsafe states, and corrects reward hacking before deploying the agent.
