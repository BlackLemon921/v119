abstract: We extend structured prediction to deliberative outcomes. Specifically,
  we learn parameterized games that can map any inputs to equilibria as the outcomes.
  Standard structured prediction models rely heavily on global scoring functions and
  are therefore unable to model individual player preferences or how they respond
  to others asymmetrically. Our games take as input, e.g., UN resolution to be voted
  on, and map such contexts to initial strategies, player utilities, and interactions.
  Players are then thought to repeatedly update their strategies in response to weighted
  aggregates of other players’ choices towards maximizing their individual utilities.
  The output from the game is a sample from the resulting (near) equilibrium mixed
  strategy profile. We characterize conditions under which players’ strategies converge
  to an equilibrium in such games and when the game parameters can be provably recovered
  from observations. Empirically, we demonstrate on two real voting datasets that
  our games can recover interpretable strategic interactions, and predict strategies
  for players in new settings.
