abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming algorithms
  for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for non-monotone
  submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the currently tightest
  deterministic approximation ratio for submodular maximization subject to a $k$-matchoid
  constraint. Moreover, we propose the first streaming algorithm for monotone submodular
  maximization subject to $k$-extendible and $k$-set system constraints. Together
  with our proposed reduction, we obtain $O(k\log k)$ and $O(k^2\log k)$ approximation
  ratio for submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively.
  We extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the existing
  work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum independent set in
  randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over social networks, movie
  recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter data summarization.
