abstract: 'The problem of scheduling of workloads onto heterogeneous processors (e.g.,
  CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) is of fundamental importance in modern data centers. Current
  system schedulers rely on application/system-specific heuristics that have to be
  built on a case-by-case basis. Recent work has demonstrated ML techniques for automating
  the heuristic search by using black-box approaches which require significant training
  data and time, which make them challenging to use in practice. This paper presents
  Symphony, a scheduling framework that addresses the challenge in two ways: (i) a
  domain-driven Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) model for scheduling, which inherently
  models the resource dependencies identified from the system architecture; and (ii)
  a sampling-based technique to compute the gradients of a Bayesian model without
  performing full probabilistic inference. Together, these techniques reduce both
  the amount of training data and the time required to produce scheduling policies
  that significantly outperform black-box approaches by up to 2.2{\texttimes}.'
