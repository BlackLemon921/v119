abstract: Inspired by the Reward-Biased Maximum Likelihood Estimate method of adaptive
  control, we propose RBMLE â€“ a novel family of learning algorithms for stochastic
  multi-armed bandits (SMABs). For a broad range of SMABs including both the parametric
  Exponential Family as well as the non-parametric sub-Gaussian/Exponential family,
  we show that RBMLE yields an index policy. To choose the bias-growth rate $\alpha(t)$
  in RBMLE, we reveal the nontrivial interplay between $\alpha(t)$ and the regret
  bound that generally applies in both the Exponential Family as well as the sub-Gaussian/Exponential
  family bandits. To quantify the finite-time performance, we prove that RBMLE attains
  order-optimality by adaptively estimating the unknown constants in the expression
  of $\alpha(t)$ for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that the proposed RBMLE achieves empirical regret performance competitive with the
  state-of-the-art methods, while being more computationally efficient and scalable
  in comparison to the best-performing ones among them.
