abstract: We investigate the connections between neural networks and simple building
  blocks in kernel space. In particular, using well established feature space tools
  such as direct sum, averaging, and moment lifting, we present an algebra for creating
  “compositional” kernels from bags of features. We show that these operations correspond
  to many of the building blocks of “neural tangent kernels (NTK)”. Experimentally,
  we show that there is a correlation in test error between neural network architectures
  and the associated kernels. We construct a simple neural network architecture using
  only 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 average pooling, ReLU, and optimized with SGD and MSE
  loss that achieves 96% accuracy on CIFAR10, and whose corresponding compositional
  kernel achieves 90% accuracy. We also use our constructions to investigate the relative
  performance of neural networks, NTKs, and compositional kernels in the small dataset
  regime. In particular, we find that compositional kernels outperform NTKs and neural
  networks outperform both kernel methods.
