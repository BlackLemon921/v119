abstract: We propose a novel framework for structured bandits, which we call an influence
  diagram bandit. Our framework uses a graphical model to capture complex statistical
  dependencies between actions, latent variables, and observations; and thus unifies
  and extends many existing models, such as combinatorial semi-bandits, cascading
  bandits, and low-rank bandits. We develop novel online learning algorithms that
  learn to act efficiently in our models. The key idea is to track a structured posterior
  distribution of model parameters, either exactly or approximately. To act, we sample
  model parameters from their posterior and then use the structure of the influence
  diagram to find the most optimistic action under the sampled parameters. We empirically
  evaluate our algorithms in three structured bandit problems, and show that they
  perform as well as or better than problem-specific state-of-the-art baselines.
