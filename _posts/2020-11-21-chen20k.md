abstract: Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies
  a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product. The vast
  number of possible chemical transformations makes the size of the search space very
  big, and retrosynthetic planning is challenging even for experienced chemists. However,
  existing methods either require expensive return estimation by rollout with high
  variance, or optimize for search speed rather than the quality. In this paper, we
  propose Retro*, a neural-based A*-like algorithm that finds high-quality synthetic
  routes efficiently. It maintains the search as an AND-OR tree, and learns a neural
  search bias with off-policy data. Then guided by this neural network, it performs
  best-first search efficiently during new planning episodes. Experiments on benchmark
  USPTO datasets show that, our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  with respect to both the success rate and solution quality, while being more efficient
  at the same time.
