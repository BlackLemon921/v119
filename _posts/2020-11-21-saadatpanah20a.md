abstract: It is well-known that many machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial
  attacks, in which an attacker evades a classifier by making small perturbations
  to inputs. This paper discusses how industrial copyright detection tools, which
  serve a central role on the web, are susceptible to adversarial attacks. As proof
  of concept, we describe a well-known music identification method and implement this
  system in the form of a neural net. We then attack this system using simple gradient
  methods and show that it is easily broken with white-box attacks. By scaling these
  perturbations up, we can create transfer attacks on industrial systems, such as
  the AudioTag copyright detector and YouTubeâ€™s Content ID system, using perturbations
  that are audible but significantly smaller than a random baseline. Our goal is to
  raise awareness of the threats posed by adversarial examples in this space and to
  highlight the importance of hardening copyright detection systems to attacks.
