abstract: When predictions support decisions they may influence the outcome they aim
  to predict. We call such predictions performative; the prediction influences the
  target. Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so
  far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces
  as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining. We develop
  a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts
  from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium
  notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions
  are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest
  from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions
  for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal
  loss. In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting
  known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions
  for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.
