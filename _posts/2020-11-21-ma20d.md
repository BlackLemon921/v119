abstract: Optimization models with non-convex constraints arise in many tasks in machine
  learning, e.g., learning with fairness constraints or Neyman-Pearson classification
  with non-convex loss. Although many efficient methods have been developed with theoretical
  convergence guarantees for non-convex unconstrained problems, it remains a challenge
  to design provably efficient algorithms for problems with non-convex functional
  constraints. This paper proposes a class of subgradient methods for constrained
  optimization where the objective function and the constraint functions are weakly
  convex and nonsmooth. Our methods solve a sequence of strongly convex subproblems,
  where a quadratic regularization term is added to both the objective function and
  each constraint function. Each subproblem can be solved by various algorithms for
  strongly convex optimization. Under a uniform Slaterâ€™s condition, we establish the
  computation complexities of our methods for finding a nearly stationary point.
