abstract: 'Real-world datasets are often biased with respect to key demographic factors
  such as race and gender. Due to the latent nature of the underlying factors, detecting
  and mitigating bias is especially challenging for unsupervised machine learning.
  We present a weakly supervised algorithm for overcoming dataset bias for deep generative
  models. Our approach requires access to an additional small, unlabeled reference
  dataset as the supervision signal, thus sidestepping the need for explicit labels
  on the underlying bias factors. Using this supplementary dataset, we detect the
  bias in existing datasets via a density ratio technique and learn generative models
  which efficiently achieve the twin goals of: 1) data efficiency by using training
  examples from both biased and reference datasets for learning; and 2) data generation
  close in distribution to the reference dataset at test time. Empirically, we demonstrate
  the efficacy of our approach which reduces bias w.r.t. latent factors by an average
  of up to 34.6% over baselines for comparable image generation using generative adversarial
  networks.'
