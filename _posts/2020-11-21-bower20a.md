abstract: 'We consider the problem of estimating a ranking on a set of items from
  noisy pairwise comparisons given item features. We address the fact that pairwise
  comparison data often reflects irrational choice, e.g. intransitivity. Our key observation
  is that two items compared in isolation from other items may be compared based on
  only a salient subset of features. Formalizing this framework, we propose the salient
  feature preference model and prove a finite sample complexity result for learning
  the parameters of our model and the underlying ranking with maximum likelihood estimation.
  We also provide empirical results that support our theoretical bounds and illustrate
  how our model explains systematic intransitivity. Finally we demonstrate strong
  performance of maximum likelihood estimation of our model on both synthetic data
  and two real data sets: the UT Zappos50K data set and comparison data about the
  compactness of legislative districts in the US.'
