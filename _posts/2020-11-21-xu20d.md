abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are effective in generating realistic
  images but the training is often unstable. There are existing efforts that model
  the training dynamics of GANs in the parameter space but the analysis cannot directly
  motivate practically effective stabilizing methods. To this end, we present a conceptually
  novel perspective from control theory to directly model the dynamics of GANs in
  the frequency domain and provide simple yet effective methods to stabilize GAN’s
  training. We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical Dirac GAN and
  adopt the widely-used closed-loop control (CLC) to improve its stability. We then
  extend CLC to stabilize the training dynamic of normal GANs, which can be implemented
  as an L2 regularizer on the output of the discriminator. Empirical results show
  that our method can effectively stabilize the training and obtain state-of-the-art
  performance on data generation tasks.
