abstract: We study the problem of estimating the distribution of effect sizes (the
  mean of the test statistic under the alternate hypothesis) in a multiple testing
  setting. Knowing this distribution allows us to calculate the power (type II error)
  of any experimental design. We show that it is possible to estimate this distribution
  using an inexpensive pilot experiment, which takes significantly fewer samples than
  would be required by an experiment that identified the discoveries. Our estimator
  can be used to guarantee the number of discoveries that will be made using a given
  experimental design in a future experiment. We prove that this simple and computationally
  efficient estimator enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties, and demonstrate
  its effectiveness on data from a gene knockout experiment on influenza inhibition
  in Drosophila.
