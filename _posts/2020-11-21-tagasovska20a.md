abstract: Causal inference using observational data is challenging, especially in
  the bivariate case. Through the minimum description length principle, we link the
  postulate of independence between the generating mechanisms of the cause and of
  the effect given the cause to quantile regression. Based on this theory, we develop
  Bivariate Quantile Causal Discovery (bQCD), a new method to distinguish cause from
  effect assuming no confounding, selection bias or feedback. Because it uses multiple
  quantile levels instead of the conditional mean only, bQCD is adaptive not only
  to additive, but also to multiplicative or even location-scale generating mechanisms.
  To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform an extensive empirical
  comparison on both synthetic and real datasets. This study shows that bQCD is robust
  across different implementations of the method (i.e., the quantile regression),
  computationally efficient, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.
