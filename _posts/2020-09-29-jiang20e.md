abstract: Recent work showed that overparameterized autoencoders can be trained to
  implement associative memory via iterative maps, when the trained input-output Jacobian
  of the network has all of its eigenvalue norms strictly below one. Here, we theoretically
  analyze this phenomenon for sigmoid networks by leveraging recent developments in
  deep learning theory, especially the correspondence between training neural networks
  in the infinite-width limit and performing kernel regression with the Neural Tangent
  Kernel (NTK). We find that overparameterized sigmoid autoencoders can have attractors
  in the NTK limit for both training with a single example and multiple examples under
  certain conditions. In particular, for multiple training examples, we find that
  the norm of the largest Jacobian eigenvalue drops below one with increasing input
  norm, leading to associative memory.
