abstract: With a view to bridging the gap between deep learning and symbolic AI, we
  present a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that learns to form propositional
  representations with an explicitly relational structure from raw pixel data. In
  order to evaluate and analyse the architecture, we introduce a family of simple
  visual relational reasoning tasks of varying complexity. We show that the proposed
  architecture, when pre-trained on a curriculum of such tasks, learns to generate
  reusable representations that better facilitate subsequent learning on previously
  unseen tasks when compared to a number of baseline architectures. The workings of
  a successfully trained model are visualised to shed some light on how the architecture
  functions.
