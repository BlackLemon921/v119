abstract: A longstanding goal in the theory of deep learning is to characterize the
  conditions under which a given neural network architecture will be trainable, and
  if so, how well it might generalize to unseen data. In this work, we provide such
  a characterization in the limit of very wide and very deep networks, for which the
  analysis simplifies considerably. For wide networks, the trajectory under gradient
  descent is governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and for deep networks the
  NTK itself maintains only weak data dependence. By analyzing the spectrum of the
  NTK, we formulate necessary conditions for trainability and generalization across
  a range of architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs). We identify large regions of hyperparameter space for which
  networks can memorize the training set but completely fail to generalize. We find
  that CNNs without global average pooling behave almost identically to FCNs, but
  that CNNs with pooling have markedly different and often better generalization performance.
  These theoretical results are corroborated experimentally on CIFAR10 for a variety
  of network architectures. We include a \href{https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/neural-tangents/blob/master/notebooks/disentangling_trainability_and_generalization.ipynb}{colab}
  notebook that reproduces the essential results of the paper.
