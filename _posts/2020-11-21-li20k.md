abstract: Irregularly-sampled time series occur in many domains including healthcare.
  They can be challenging to model because they do not naturally yield a fixed-dimensional
  representation as required by many standard machine learning models. In this paper,
  we consider irregular sampling from the perspective of missing data. We model observed
  irregularly-sampled time series data as a sequence of index-value pairs sampled
  from a continuous but unobserved function. We introduce an encoder-decoder framework
  for learning from such generic indexed sequences. We propose learning methods for
  this framework based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.
  For continuous irregularly-sampled time series, we introduce continuous convolutional
  layers that can efficiently interface with existing neural network architectures.
  Experiments show that our models are able to achieve competitive or better classification
  results on irregularly-sampled multivariate time series compared to recent RNN models
  while offering significantly faster training times.
