abstract: 'The seasonal epidemic of influenza costs thousands of lives each year in
  the US. While influenza epidemics occur every year, timing and size of the epidemic
  vary strongly from season to season. This complicates the public health efforts
  to adequately respond to such epidemics. Forecasting techniques to predict the development
  of seasonal epidemics such as influenza, are of great help to public health decision
  making. Therefore, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initiated
  a yearly challenge to forecast influenza-like illness. Here, we propose a new framework
  based on Gaussian process (GP) for seasonal epidemics forecasting and demonstrate
  its capability on the CDC reference data on influenza like illness: our framework
  leads to accurate forecasts with small but reliable uncertainty estimation. We compare
  our framework to several state of the art benchmarks and show competitive performance.
  We, therefore, believe that our GP based framework for seasonal epidemics forecasting
  will play a key role for future influenza forecasting and, lead to further research
  in the area.'
