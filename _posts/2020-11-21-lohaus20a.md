abstract: 'We address the problem of classification under fairness constraints. Given
  a notion of fairness, the goal is to learn a classifier that is not discriminatory
  against a group of individuals. In the literature, this problem is often formulated
  as a constrained optimization problem and solved using relaxations of the fairness
  constraints. We show that many existing relaxations are unsatisfactory: even if
  a model satisfies the relaxed constraint, it can be surprisingly unfair. We propose
  a principled framework to solve this problem. This new approach uses a strongly
  convex formulation and comes with theoretical guarantees on the fairness of its
  solution. In practice, we show that this method gives promising results on real
  data.'
