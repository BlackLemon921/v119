abstract: To simultaneously capture syntax and global semantics from a text corpus,
  we propose a new larger-context recurrent neural network (RNN) based language model,
  which extracts recurrent hierarchical semantic structure via a dynamic deep topic
  model to guide natural language generation. Moving beyond a conventional RNN-based
  language model that ignores long-range word dependencies and sentence order, the
  proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal
  transitions between sentences and inter-sentence topic dependencies. For inference,
  we develop a hybrid of stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo and recurrent
  autoencoding variational Bayes. Experimental results on a variety of real-world
  text corpora demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms larger-context
  RNN-based language models, but also learns interpretable recurrent multilayer topics
  and generates diverse sentences and paragraphs that are syntactically correct and
  semantically coherent.
