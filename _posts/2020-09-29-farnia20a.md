abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent a zero-sum game between
  two machine players, a generator and a discriminator, designed to learn the distribution
  of data. While GANs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark
  learning tasks, GAN minimax optimization still poses great theoretical and empirical
  challenges. GANs trained using first-order optimization methods commonly fail to
  converge to a stable solution where the players cannot improve their objective,
  i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the underlying game. Such issues raise the question
  of the existence of Nash equilibria in GAN zero-sum games. In this work, we show
  through theoretical and numerical results that indeed GAN zero-sum games may have
  no Nash equilibria. To characterize an equilibrium notion applicable to GANs, we
  consider the equilibrium of a new zero-sum game with an objective function given
  by a proximal operator applied to the original objective, a solution we call the
  proximal equilibrium. Unlike the Nash equilibrium, the proximal equilibrium captures
  the sequential nature of GANs, in which the generator moves first followed by the
  discriminator. We prove that the optimal generative model in Wasserstein GAN problems
  provides a proximal equilibrium. Inspired by these results, we propose a new approach,
  which we call proximal training, for solving GAN problems. We perform several numerical
  experiments indicating the existence of proximal equilibria in GANs.
