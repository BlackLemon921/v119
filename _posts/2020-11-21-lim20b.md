abstract: We introduce a new framework for the exact point-wise ℓp robustness verification
  problem that exploits the layer-wise geometric structure of deep feed-forward networks
  with rectified linear activations (ReLU networks). The activation regions of the
  network partition the input space, and one can verify the ℓp robustness around a
  point by checking all the activation regions within the desired radius. The GeoCert
  algorithm (Jordan et al., NeurIPS 2019) treats this partition as a generic polyhedral
  complex in order to detect which region to check next. In contrast, our LayerCert
  framework considers the nested hyperplane arrangement structure induced by the layers
  of the ReLU network and explores regions in a hierarchical manner. We show that,
  under certain conditions on the algorithm parameters, LayerCert provably reduces
  the number and size of the convex programs that one needs to solve compared to GeoCert.
  Furthermore, our LayerCert framework allows the incorporation of lower bounding
  routines based on convex relaxations to further improve performance. Experimental
  results demonstrate that LayerCert can significantly reduce both the number of convex
  programs solved and the running time over the state-of-the-art.
