abstract: We are interested in learning algorithms that optimize revenue in repeated
  contextual posted-price auctions where a single seller faces a single strategic
  buyer. In our setting, the buyer maximizes his expected cumulative discounted surplus,
  and his valuation of a good is assumed to be a fixed function of a $d$-dimensional
  context (feature) vector. We introduce a novel deterministic learning algorithm
  that is based on ideas of the Bisection method and has strategic regret upper bound
  of $O(\log^2 T)$. Unlike previous works, our algorithm does not require any assumption
  on the distribution of context information, and the regret guarantee holds for any
  realization of feature vectors (adversarial upper bound). To construct our algorithm
  we non-trivially adopted techniques of integral geometry to act against buyer strategicness
  and improved the penalization trick to work in contextual auctions.
