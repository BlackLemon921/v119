abstract: Bandit learning algorithms typically involve the balance of exploration
  and exploitation. However, in many practical applications, worst-case scenarios
  needing systematic exploration are seldom encountered. In this work, we consider
  a smoothed setting for structured linear contextual bandits where the adversarial
  contexts are perturbed by Gaussian noise and the unknown parameter $\theta^*$ has
  structure, e.g., sparsity, group sparsity, low rank, etc. We propose simple greedy
  algorithms for both the single- and multi-parameter (i.e., different parameter for
  each context) settings and provide a unified regret analysis for $\theta^*$ with
  any assumed structure. The regret bounds are expressed in terms of geometric quantities
  such as Gaussian widths associated with the structure of $\theta^*$. We also obtain
  sharper regret bounds compared to earlier work for the unstructured $\theta^*$ setting
  as a consequence of our improved analysis. We show there is implicit exploration
  in the smoothed setting where a simple greedy algorithm works.
