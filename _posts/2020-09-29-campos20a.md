abstract: Acquiring abilities in the absence of a task-oriented reward function is
  at the frontier of reinforcement learning research. This problem has been studied
  through the lens of empowerment, which draws a connection between option discovery
  and information theory. Information-theoretic skill discovery methods have garnered
  much interest from the community, but little research has been conducted in understanding
  their limitations. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show
  that existing algorithms suffer from a common limitation â€“ they discover options
  that provide a poor coverage of the state space. In light of this, we propose Explore,
  Discover and Learn (EDL), an alternative approach to information-theoretic skill
  discovery. Crucially, EDL optimizes the same information-theoretic objective derived
  from the empowerment literature, but addresses the optimization problem using different
  machinery. We perform an extensive evaluation of skill discovery methods on controlled
  environments and show that EDL offers significant advantages, such as overcoming
  the coverage problem, reducing the dependence of learned skills on the initial state,
  and allowing the user to define a prior over which behaviors should be learned.
