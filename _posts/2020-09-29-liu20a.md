abstract: Off-policy policy estimators that use importance sampling (IS) can suffer
  from high variance in long-horizon domains, and there has been particular excitement
  over new IS methods that leverage the structure of Markov decision processes. We
  analyze the variance of the most popular approaches through the viewpoint of conditional
  Monte Carlo. Surprisingly, we find that in finite horizon MDPs there is no strict
  variance reduction of per-decision importance sampling or marginalized importance
  sampling, comparing with vanilla importance sampling. We then provide sufficient
  conditions under which the per-decision or marginalized estimators will provably
  reduce the variance over importance sampling with finite horizons. For the asymptotic
  (in terms of horizon $T$) case, we develop upper and lower bounds on the variance
  of those estimators which yields sufficient conditions under which there exists
  an exponential v.s. polynomial gap between the variance of importance sampling and
  that of the per-decision or stationary/marginalized estimators. These results help
  advance our understanding of if and when new types of IS estimators will improve
  the accuracy of off-policy estimation.
