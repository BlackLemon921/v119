abstract: Deep neural networks are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
  This motivates robust learning techniques, such as the adversarial training, whose
  goal is to learn a network that is robust against adversarial attacks. However,
  the sample complexity of robust learning can be significantly larger than that of
  “standard” learning. In this paper, we propose improving the adversarial robustness
  of a network by leveraging the potentially large test data seen at runtime. We devise
  a new defense method, called runtime masking and cleansing (RMC), that adapts the
  network at runtime before making a prediction to dynamically mask network gradients
  and cleanse the model of the non-robust features inevitably learned during the training
  process due to the size limit of the training set. We conduct experiments on real-world
  datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RMC empirically.
