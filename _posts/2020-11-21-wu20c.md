abstract: 'The gradient noise of SGD is considered to play a central role in the observed
  strong generalization abilities of deep learning. While past studies confirm that
  the magnitude and the covariance structure of gradient noise are critical for regularization,
  it remains unclear whether or not the class of noise distributions is important.
  In this work we provide negative results by showing that noises in classes different
  from the SGD noise can also effectively regularize gradient descent. Our finding
  is based on a novel observation on the structure of the SGD noise: it is the multiplication
  of the gradient matrix and a sampling noise that arises from the mini-batch sampling
  procedure. Moreover, the sampling noises unify two kinds of gradient regularizing
  noises that belong to the Gaussian class: the one using (scaled) Fisher as covariance
  and the one using the gradient covariance of SGD as covariance. Finally, thanks
  to the flexibility of choosing noise class, an algorithm is proposed to perform
  noisy gradient descent that generalizes well, the variant of which even benefits
  large batch SGD training without hurting generalization.'
