abstract: Gating mechanisms are widely used in neural network models, where they allow
  gradients to backpropagate easily through depth or time. However, their saturation
  property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these
  gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays,
  which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based
  learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic
  modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce
  no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are
  close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative
  recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono-initialization and Ordered Neurons.
  Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent
  models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential
  image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly
  when long-term dependencies are involved.
