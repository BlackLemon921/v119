abstract: 'Contrastive representation learning has been outstandingly successful in
  practice. In this work, we identify two key properties related to the contrastive
  loss: (1) alignment (closeness) of features from positive pairs, and (2) uniformity
  of the induced distribution of the (normalized) features on the hypersphere. We
  prove that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss optimizes these properties, and
  analyze their positive effects on downstream tasks. Empirically, we introduce an
  optimizable metric to quantify each property. Extensive experiments on standard
  vision and language datasets confirm the strong agreement between both metrics and
  downstream task performance. Directly optimizing for these two metrics leads to
  representations with comparable or better performance at downstream tasks than contrastive
  learning.'
