abstract: Operator-Valued Kernels (OVKs) and associated vector-valued Reproducing
  Kernel Hilbert Spaces provide an elegant way to extend scalar kernel methods when
  the output space is a Hilbert space. Although primarily used in finite dimension
  for problems like multi-task regression, the ability of this framework to deal with
  infinite dimensional output spaces unlocks many more applications, such as functional
  regression, structured output prediction, and structured data representation. However,
  these sophisticated schemes crucially rely on the kernel trick in the output space,
  so that most of previous works have focused on the square norm loss function, completely
  neglecting robustness issues that may arise in such surrogate problems. To overcome
  this limitation, this paper develops a duality approach that allows to solve OVK
  machines for a wide range of loss functions. The infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers
  are handled through a Double Representer Theorem, and algorithms for \epsilon-insensitive
  losses and the Huber loss are thoroughly detailed. Robustness benefits are emphasized
  by a theoretical stability analysis, as well as empirical improvements on structured
  data applications.
