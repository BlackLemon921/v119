abstract: Drug discovery aims to find novel compounds with specified chemical property
  profiles. In terms of generative modeling, the goal is to learn to sample molecules
  in the intersection of multiple property constraints. This task becomes increasingly
  challenging when there are many property constraints. We propose to offset this
  complexity by composing molecules from a vocabulary of substructures that we call
  molecular rationales. These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures
  that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand
  rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative
  model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this
  mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest. We evaluate our model
  on various drug design tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
  baselines in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty of generated compounds.
