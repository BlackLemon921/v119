abstract: 'Neural networks with binary weights are computation-efficient and hardware-friendly,
  but their training is challenging because it involves a discrete optimization problem.
  Surprisingly, ignoring the discrete nature of the problem and using gradient-based
  methods, such as the Straight-Through Estimator, still works well in practice. This
  raises the question: are there principled approaches which justify such methods?
  In this paper, we propose such an approach using the Bayesian learning rule. The
  rule, when applied to estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights,
  results in an algorithm which justifies some of the algorithmic choices made by
  the previous approaches. The algorithm not only obtains state-of-the-art performance,
  but also enables uncertainty estimation and continual learning to avoid catastrophic
  forgetting. Our work provides a principled approach for training binary neural networks
  which also justifies and extends existing approaches.'
