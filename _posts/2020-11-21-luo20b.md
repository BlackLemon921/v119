abstract: Domain shift is a fundamental problem in visual recognition which typically
  arises when the source and target data follow different distributions. The existing
  domain adaptation approaches which tackle this problem work in the "closed-set"
  setting with the assumption that the source and the target data share exactly the
  same classes of objects. In this paper, we tackle a more realistic problem of the
  "open-set" domain shift where the target data contains additional classes that were
  not present in the source data. More specifically, we introduce an end-to-end Progressive
  Graph Learning (PGL) framework where a graph neural network with episodic training
  is integrated to suppress underlying conditional shift and adversarial learning
  is adopted to close the gap between the source and target distributions. Compared
  to the existing open-set adaptation approaches, our approach guarantees to achieve
  a tighter upper bound of the target error. Extensive experiments on three standard
  open-set benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts
  in open-set domain adaptation.
