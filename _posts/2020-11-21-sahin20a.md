abstract: Submodular functions have been studied extensively in machine learning and
  data mining. In particular, the optimization of submodular functions over the integer
  lattice (integer submodular functions) has recently attracted much interest, because
  this domain relates naturally to many practical problem settings, such as multilabel
  graph cut, budget allocation and revenue maximization with discrete assignments.
  In contrast, the use of these functions for probabilistic modeling has received
  surprisingly little attention so far. In this work, we firstly propose the Generalized
  Multilinear Extension, a continuous DR-submodular extension for integer submodular
  functions. We study central properties of this extension and formulate a new probabilistic
  model which is defined through integer submodular functions. Then, we introduce
  a block-coordinate ascent algorithm to perform approximate inference for this class
  of models and finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness and viability on several
  real-world social connection graph datasets with integer submodular objectives.
