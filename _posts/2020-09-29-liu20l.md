abstract: In recent years, a variety of gradient-based bi-level optimization methods
  have been developed for learning tasks. However, theoretical guarantees of these
  existing approaches often heavily rely on the simplification that for each fixed
  upper-level variable, the lower-level solution must be a singleton (a.k.a., Lower-Level
  Singleton, LLS). In this work, by formulating bi-level models from the optimistic
  viewpoint and aggregating hierarchical objective information, we establish Bi-level
  Descent Aggregation (BDA), a flexible and modularized algorithmic framework for
  bi-level programming. Theoretically, we derive a new methodology to prove the convergence
  of BDA without the LLS condition. Furthermore, we improve the convergence properties
  of conventional first-order bi-level schemes (under the LLS simplification) based
  on our proof recipe. Extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate
  the superiority of the proposed BDA for different tasks, including hyper-parameter
  optimization and meta learning.
