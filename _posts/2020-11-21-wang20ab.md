abstract: Thompson sampling is an efficient algorithm for sequential decision making,
  which exploits the posterior uncertainty to address the exploration-exploitation
  dilemma. There has been significant recent interest in integrating Bayesian neural
  networks into Thompson sampling. Most of these methods rely on global variable uncertainty
  for exploration. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic modeling framework
  for Thompson sampling, where local latent variable uncertainty is used to sample
  the mean reward. Variational inference is used to approximate the posterior of the
  local variable, and semi-implicit structure is further introduced to enhance its
  expressiveness. Our experimental results on eight contextual bandit benchmark datasets
  show that Thompson sampling guided by local uncertainty achieves state-of-the-art
  performance while having low computational complexity.
