abstract: Adversarial or test time robustness measures the susceptibility of a classifier
  to perturbations to the test input. While there has been a flurry of recent work
  on designing defenses against such perturbations, the theory of adversarial robustness
  is not well understood. In order to make progress on this, we focus on the problem
  of understanding generalization in adversarial settings, via the lens of Rademacher
  complexity. We give upper and lower bounds for the adversarial empirical Rademacher
  complexity of linear hypotheses with adversarial perturbations measured in $l_r$-norm
  for an arbitrary $r \geq 1$. We then extend our analysis to provide Rademacher complexity
  lower and upper bounds for a single ReLU unit. Finally, we give adversarial Rademacher
  complexity bounds for feed-forward neural networks with one hidden layer.
