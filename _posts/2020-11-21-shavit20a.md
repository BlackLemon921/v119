abstract: 'In many predictive decision-making scenarios, such as credit scoring and
  academic testing, a decision-maker must construct a model that accounts for agents’
  propensity to “game” the decision rule by changing their features so as to receive
  better decisions. Whereas the strategic classification literature has previously
  assumed that agents’ outcomes are not causally affected by their features (and thus
  that strategic agents’ goal is deceiving the decision-maker), we join concurrent
  work in modeling agents’ outcomes as a function of their changeable attributes.
  As our main contribution, we provide efficient algorithms for learning decision
  rules that optimize three distinct decision-maker objectives in a realizable linear
  setting: accurately predicting agents’ post-gaming outcomes (prediction risk minimization),
  incentivizing agents to improve these outcomes (agent outcome maximization), and
  estimating the coefficients of the true underlying model (parameter estimation).
  Our algorithms circumvent a hardness result of Miller et al. (2019) by allowing
  the decision maker to test a sequence of decision rules and observe agents’ responses,
  in effect performing causal interventions through the decision rules.'
