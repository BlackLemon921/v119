abstract: Evidence-based decision-making entails collecting (costly) observations
  about an underlying phenomenon of interest, and subsequently committing to an (informed)
  decision on the basis of accumulated evidence. In this setting, *active sensing*
  is the goal-oriented problem of efficiently selecting which acquisitions to make,
  and when and what decision to settle on. As its complement, *inverse active sensing*
  seeks to uncover an agent’s preferences and strategy given their observable decision-making
  behavior. In this paper, we develop an expressive, unified framework for the general
  setting of evidence-based decision-making under endogenous, context-dependent time
  pressure—which requires negotiating (subjective) tradeoffs between accuracy, speediness,
  and cost of information. Using this language, we demonstrate how it enables *modeling*
  intuitive notions of surprise, suspense, and optimality in decision strategies (the
  forward problem). Finally, we illustrate how this formulation enables *understanding*
  decision-making behavior by quantifying preferences implicit in observed decision
  strategies (the inverse problem).
