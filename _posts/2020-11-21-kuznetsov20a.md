abstract: 'The overestimation bias is one of the major impediments to accurate off-policy
  learning. This paper investigates a novel way to alleviate the overestimation bias
  in a continuous control setting. Our method—Truncated Quantile Critics, TQC,—blends
  three ideas: distributional representation of a critic, truncation of critics prediction,
  and ensembling of multiple critics. Distributional representation and truncation
  allow for arbitrary granular overestimation control, while ensembling provides additional
  score improvements. TQC outperforms the current state of the art on all environments
  from the continuous control benchmark suite, demonstrating 25% improvement on the
  most challenging Humanoid environment.'
