abstract: We study the problem of learning adversarially robust halfspaces in the
  distribution-independent setting. In the realizable setting, we provide necessary
  and sufficient conditions on the adversarial perturbation sets under which halfspaces
  are efficiently robustly learnable. In the presence of random label noise, we give
  a simple computationally efficient algorithm for this problem with respect to any
  $\ell_p$-perturbation.
