abstract: Inter-domain Gaussian processes (GPs) allow for high flexibility and low
  computational cost when performing approximate inference in GP models. They are
  particularly suitable for modeling data exhibiting global structure but are limited
  to stationary covariance functions and thus fail to model non-stationary data effectively.
  We propose Inter-domain Deep Gaussian Processes, an extension of inter-domain shallow
  GPs that combines the advantages of inter-domain and deep Gaussian processes (DGPs),
  and demonstrate how to leverage existing approximate inference methods to perform
  simple and scalable approximate inference using inter-domain features in DGPs. We
  assess the performance of our method on a range of regression tasks and demonstrate
  that it outperforms inter-domain shallow GPs and conventional DGPs on challenging
  large-scale real-world datasets exhibiting both global structure as well as a high-degree
  of non-stationarity.
