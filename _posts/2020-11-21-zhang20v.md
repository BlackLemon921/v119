abstract: We study the problem of learning Granger causality between event types from
  asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. Existing work suffers
  from either limited model flexibility or poor model explainability and thus fails
  to uncover Granger causality across a wide variety of event sequences with diverse
  event interdependency. To address these weaknesses, we propose CAUSE (Causality
  from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework for the studied task.
  The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the underlying event interdependency
  by fitting a neural point process, and then extract from the process a Granger causality
  statistic using an axiomatic attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled
  with diverse event interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior
  performance on correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range
  of state-of-the-art methods.
