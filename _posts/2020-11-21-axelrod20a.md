abstract: 'Given data drawn from an unknown distribution, D, to what extent is it
  possible to “amplify” this dataset and faithfully output an even larger set of samples
  that appear to have been drawn from D? We formalize this question as follows: an
  (n,m) amplification procedure takes as input n independent draws from an unknown
  distribution D, and outputs a set of m > n “samples” which must be indistinguishable
  from m samples drawn iid from D. We consider this sample amplification problem in
  two fundamental settings: the case where D is an arbitrary discrete distribution
  supported on k elements, and the case where D is a d-dimensional Gaussian with unknown
  mean, and fixed covariance matrix. Perhaps surprisingly, we show a valid amplification
  procedure exists for both of these settings, even in the regime where the size of
  the input dataset, n, is significantly less than what would be necessary to learn
  distribution D to non-trivial accuracy. We also show that our procedures are optimal
  up to constant factors. Beyond these results, we describe potential applications
  of such data amplification, and formalize a number of curious directions for future
  research along this vein.'
