abstract: 'Motivated by high-stakes decision-making domains like personalized medicine
  where user information is inherently sensitive, we design privacy preserving exploration
  policies for episodic reinforcement learning (RL). We first provide a meaningful
  privacy formulation using the notion of joint differential privacy (JDP)â€“a strong
  variant of differential privacy for settings where each user receives their own
  sets of output (e.g., policy recommendations). We then develop a private optimism-based
  learning algorithm that simultaneously achieves strong PAC and regret bounds, and
  enjoys a JDP guarantee. Our algorithm only pays for a moderate privacy cost on exploration:
  in comparison to the non-private bounds, the privacy parameter only appears in lower-order
  terms. Finally, we present lower bounds on sample complexity and regret for reinforcement
  learning subject to JDP.'
