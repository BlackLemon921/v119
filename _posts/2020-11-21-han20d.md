abstract: This paper formalizes the binarization operations over neural networks from
  a learning perspective. In contrast to classical hand crafted rules (\eg hard thresholding)
  to binarize full-precision neurons, we propose to learn a mapping from full-precision
  neurons to the target binary ones. Each individual weight entry will not be binarized
  independently. Instead, they are taken as a whole to accomplish the binarization,
  just as they work together in generating convolution features. To help the training
  of the binarization mapping, the full-precision neurons after taking sign operations
  is regarded as some auxiliary supervision signal, which is noisy but still has valuable
  guidance. An unbiased estimator is therefore introduced to mitigate the influence
  of the supervision noise. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that
  the proposed binarization technique attains consistent improvements over baselines.
