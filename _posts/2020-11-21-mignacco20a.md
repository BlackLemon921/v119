abstract: We consider a high-dimensional mixture of two Gaussians in the noisy regime
  where even an oracle knowing the centers of the clusters misclassifies a small but
  finite fraction of the points. We provide a rigorous analysis of the generalization
  error of regularized convex classifiers, including ridge, hinge and logistic regression,
  in the high-dimensional limit where the number $n$ of samples and their dimension
  $d$ go to infinity while their ratio is fixed to $\alpha=n/d$. We discuss surprising
  effects of the regularization that in some cases allows to reach the Bayes-optimal
  performances. We also illustrate the interpolation peak at low regularization, and
  analyze the role of the respective sizes of the two clusters.
