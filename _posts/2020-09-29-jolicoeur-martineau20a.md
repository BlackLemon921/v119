abstract: We take a more rigorous look at Relativistic Generative Adversarial Networks
  (RGANs) and prove that the objective function of the discriminator is a statistical
  divergence for any concave function f with minimal properties. We devise additional
  variants of relativistic f-divergences. We show that the Wasserstein distance is
  weaker than f-divergences which are weaker than relativistic f-divergences. Given
  the good performance of RGANs, this suggests that Wasserstein GAN does not performs
  well primarily because of the weak metric, but rather because of regularization
  and the use of a relativistic discriminator. We introduce the minimum-variance unbiased
  estimator (MVUE) for Relativistic paired GANs (RpGANs; originally called RGANs which
  could bring confusion) and show that it does not perform better. We show that the
  estimator of Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs) is asymptotically unbiased and that
  the finite-sample bias is small; removing this bias does not improve performance.
