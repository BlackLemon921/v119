abstract: Stochastic gradient methods with momentum are widely used in applications
  and at the core of optimization subroutines in many popular machine learning libraries.
  However, their sample complexities have not been obtained for problems beyond those
  that are convex or smooth. This paper establishes the convergence rate of a stochastic
  subgradient method with a momentum term of Polyak type for a broad class of non-smooth,
  non-convex, and constrained optimization problems. Our key innovation is the construction
  of a special Lyapunov function for which the proven complexity can be achieved without
  any tuning of the momentum parameter. For smooth problems, we extend the known complexity
  bound to the constrained case and demonstrate how the unconstrained case can be
  analyzed under weaker assumptions than the state-of-the-art. Numerical results confirm
  our theoretical developments.
