abstract: In E-commerce, advertising is essential for merchants to reach their target
  users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiserâ€™s cumulative revenue
  over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an advertisement
  (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times until the user
  finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However, existing advertising
  systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single ad exposures, ignoring
  the contribution of each exposure to the final conversion, thus usually falls into
  suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential advertising strategy
  optimization as a dynamic knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed
  bilevel optimization framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of
  the original optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve
  the exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective
  action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show the
  superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in terms
  of cumulative revenue.
