abstract: Initialization, normalization, and skip connections are believed to be three
  indispensable techniques for training very deep convolutional neural networks and
  obtaining state-of-the-art performance. This paper shows that deep vanilla ConvNets
  without normalization nor skip connections can also be trained to achieve surprisingly
  good performance on standard image recognition benchmarks. This is achieved by enforcing
  the convolution kernels to be near isometric during initialization and training,
  as well as by using a variant of ReLU that is shifted towards being isometric. Further
  experiments show that if combined with skip connections, such near isometric networks
  can achieve performances on par with (for ImageNet) and better than (for COCO) the
  standard ResNet, even without normalization at all. Our code is available at https://github.com/HaozhiQi/ISONet.
