abstract: Significant work has been recently dedicated to the stochastic delayed bandits
  because of its relevance in applications. The applicability of existing algorithms
  is however restricted by the fact that strong assumptions are often made on the
  delay distributions, such as full observability, restrictive shape constraints,
  or uniformity over arms. In this work, we weaken them significantly and only assume
  that there is a bound on the tail of the delay. In particular, we cover the important
  case where the delay distributions vary across arms, and the case where the delays
  are heavy-tailed. Addressing these difficulties, we propose a simple but efficient
  UCB-based algorithm called the PatientBandits. We provide both problemsdependent
  and problems-independent bounds on the regret as well as performance lower bounds.
