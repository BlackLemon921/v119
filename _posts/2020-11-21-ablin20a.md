abstract: 'In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the
  gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no closed-form,
  and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There are two usual
  ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an analytic formula
  obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or automatic differentiation
  through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the asymptotic error made by these
  estimators as a function of the optimization error. We find that the error of the
  automatic estimator is close to the square of the error of the analytic estimator,
  reflecting a super-efficiency phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator
  greatly depends on the convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze
  it for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates
  for the estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments
  on toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the
  computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to chose
  between them.'
