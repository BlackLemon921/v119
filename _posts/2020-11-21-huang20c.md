abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has succeeded in producing astonishingly
  realistic-seeming images and audio, but quantitative evaluation remains a challenge.
  Log-likelihood is an appealing metric due to its grounding in statistics and information
  theory, but it can be challenging to estimate for implicit generative models, and
  scalar-valued metrics give an incomplete picture of a modelâ€™s quality. In this work,
  we propose to use rate distortion (RD) curves to evaluate and compare deep generative
  models. While estimating RD curves is seemingly even more computationally demanding
  than log-likelihood estimation, we show that we can approximate the entire RD curve
  using nearly the same computations as were previously used to achieve a single log-likelihood
  estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of VAEs, GANs, and adversarial autoencoders
  (AAEs) on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Measuring the entire RD curve gives a
  more complete picture than scalar-valued metrics, and we arrive at a number of insights
  not obtainable from log-likelihoods alone.
