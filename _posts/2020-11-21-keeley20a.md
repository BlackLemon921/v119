abstract: Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) has been broadly applied to the
  problem of identifying smooth, low-dimensional temporal structure underlying large-scale
  neural recordings. However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, which motivates combining
  GPFA with discrete observation models for binned spike count data. The drawback
  to this approach is that GPFA priors are not conjugate to count model likelihoods,
  which makes inference challenging. Here we address this obstacle by introducing
  a fast, approximate inference method for non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach
  uses orthogonal second-order polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms in the
  non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a method we refer to as polynomial approximate
  log-likelihood (PAL) estimators. This approximation allows for accurate closed-form
  evaluation of marginal likelihoods and fast numerical optimization for parameters
  and hyperparameters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFA models with binomial, Poisson,
  and negative binomial observations and find the PAL estimation is highly accurate,
  and achieves faster convergence times compared to existing state-of-the-art inference
  methods. We also find that PAL hyperparameters can provide sensible initialization
  for black box variational inference (BBVI), which improves BBVI accuracy. We demonstrate
  that PAL estimators achieve fast and accurate extraction of latent structure from
  multi-neuron spike train data.
