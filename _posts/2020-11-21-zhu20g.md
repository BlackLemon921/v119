abstract: We consider a single-product dynamic pricing problem under a specific non-stationary
  setting, where the underlying demand process grows over time in expectation and
  also possibly in the level of random fluctuation. The decision maker sequentially
  sets price in each time period and learns the unknown demand model, with the goal
  of maximizing expected cumulative revenue over a time horizon $T$. We prove matching
  upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal pricing policies, showing
  how the growth rate of random fluctuation over time affects the best achievable
  regret order and the near-optimal policy design. In the analysis, we show that whether
  the seller knows the length of time horizon $T$ in advance or not surprisingly render
  different optimal regret orders. We then extend the demand model such that the optimal
  price may vary with time and present a novel and near-optimal policy for the extended
  model. Finally, we consider an analogous non-stationary setting in the canonical
  multi-armed bandit problem, and points out that knowing or not knowing the length
  of time horizon $T$ render the same optimal regret order, in contrast to the non-stationary
  dynamic pricing problem.
