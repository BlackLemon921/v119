abstract: Recent research has shown that incorporating equivariance into neural network
  architectures is very helpful, and there have been some works investigating the
  equivariance of networks under group actions. However, as digital images and feature
  maps are on the discrete meshgrid, corresponding equivariance-preserving transformation
  groups are very limited. In this work, we deal with this issue from the connection
  between convolutions and partial differential operators (PDOs). In theory, assuming
  inputs to be smooth, we transform PDOs and propose a system which is equivariant
  to a much more general continuous group, the $n$-dimension Euclidean group. In implementation,
  we discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving approximately
  equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the approximation error of
  PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first time that the error analysis
  is provided when the equivariance is approximate. Extensive experiments on rotated
  MNIST and natural image classification show that PDO-eConvs perform competitively
  yet use parameters much more efficiently. Particularly, compared with Wide ResNets,
  our methods result in better results using only 12.6% parameters.
