abstract: We study the stochastic contextual bandit problem, where the reward is generated
  from an unknown function with additive noise. No assumption is made about the reward
  function other than boundedness. We propose a new algorithm, NeuralUCB, which leverages
  the representation power of deep neural networks and uses a neural network-based
  random feature mapping to construct an upper confidence bound (UCB) of reward for
  efficient exploration. We prove that, under standard assumptions, NeuralUCB achieves
  $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of rounds. To the best of our
  knowledge, it is the first neural network-based contextual bandit algorithm with
  a near-optimal regret guarantee. We also show the algorithm is empirically competitive
  against representative baselines in a number of benchmarks.
