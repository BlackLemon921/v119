abstract: Generating formal-language programs represented by relational tuples, such
  as Lisp programs or mathematical operations, to solve problems stated in natural
  language is a challenging task because it requires explicitly capturing discrete
  symbolic structural information implicit in the input. However, most general neural
  sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural information, limiting
  their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder
  model based on a structured neural representation, Tensor Product Representations
  (TPRs), for mapping Natural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called
  TP-N2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR ‘binding’ to encode natural-language symbolic
  structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR ‘unbinding’ to generate, in symbolic
  space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each consisting of
  a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F considerably outperforms
  LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and creates new state-of-the-art results.
  Ablation studies show that improvements can be attributed to the use of structured
  TPRs explicitly in both the encoder and decoder. Analysis of the learned structures
  shows how TPRs enhance the interpretability of TP-N2F.
