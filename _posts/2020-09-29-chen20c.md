abstract: There is a recent surge of interest in designing deep architectures based
  on the update steps in traditional algorithms, or learning neural networks to improve
  and replace traditional algorithms. While traditional algorithms have certain stopping
  criteria for outputting results at different iterations, many algorithm-inspired
  deep models are restricted to a “fixed-depth” for all inputs. Similar to algorithms,
  the optimal depth of a deep architecture may be different for different input instances,
  either to avoid “over-thinking”, or because we want to compute less for operations
  converged already. In this paper, we tackle this varying depth problem using a steerable
  architecture, where a feed-forward deep model and a variational stopping policy
  are learned together to sequentially determine the optimal number of layers for
  each input instance. Training such architecture is very challenging. We provide
  a variational Bayes perspective and design a novel and effective training procedure
  which decomposes the task into an oracle model learning stage and an imitation stage.
  Experimentally, we show that the learned deep model along with the stopping policy
  improves the performances on a diverse set of tasks, including learning sparse recovery,
  few-shot meta learning, and computer vision tasks.
