abstract: We provide an end-to-end differentially private spectral algorithm for learning
  LDA, based on matrix/tensor decompositions, and establish theoretical guarantees
  on utility/consistency of the estimated model parameters. We represent the spectral
  algorithm as a computational graph. Noise can be injected along the edges of this
  graph to obtain differential privacy. We identify subsets of edges, named “configurations”,
  such that adding noise to all edges in such a subset guarantees differential privacy
  of the end-to-end spectral algorithm. We characterize the sensitivity of the edges
  with respect to the input and thus estimate the amount of noise to be added to each
  edge for any required privacy level. We then characterize the utility loss for each
  configuration as a function of injected noise. Overall, by combining the sensitivity
  and utility characterization, we obtain an end-to-end differentially private spectral
  algorithm for LDA and identify which configurations outperform others under specific
  regimes. We are the first to achieve utility guarantees under a required level of
  differential privacy for learning in LDA. We additionally show that our method systematically
  outperforms differentially private variational inference.
