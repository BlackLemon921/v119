abstract: We propose an accelerated version of stochastic variance reduced coordinate
  descent – ASVRCD. As other variance reduced coordinate descent methods such as SEGA
  or SVRCD, our method can deal with problems that include a non-separable and non-smooth
  regularizer, while accessing a random block of partial derivatives in each iteration
  only. However, ASVRCD incorporates Nesterov’s momentum, which offers favorable iteration
  complexity guarantees over both SEGA and SVRCD. As a by-product of our theory, we
  show that a variant of Katyusha (Allen-Zhu, 2017) is a specific case of ASVRCD,
  recovering the optimal oracle complexity for the finite sum objective.
