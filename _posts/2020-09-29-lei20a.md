abstract: This paper studies a problem of learning surface mesh via implicit functions
  in an emerging field of deep learning surface reconstruction, where implicit functions
  are popularly implemented as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with rectified linear
  units (ReLU). To achieve meshing from the learned implicit functions, existing methods
  adopt the de-facto standard algorithm of marching cubes; while promising, they suffer
  from loss of precision learned in the MLPs, due to the discretization nature of
  marching cubes. Motivated by the knowledge that a ReLU based MLP partitions its
  input space into a number of linear regions, we identify from these regions analytic
  cells and faces that are associated with zero-level isosurface of the implicit function,
  and characterize the conditions under which the identified faces are guaranteed
  to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. We propose a naturally parallelizable
  algorithm of analytic marching to exactly recover the mesh captured by a learned
  MLP. Experiments on deep learning mesh reconstruction verify the advantages of our
  algorithm over existing ones.
