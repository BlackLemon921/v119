abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have been the dominating approach to conditional
  sequence generation, but are suffering from the issue of high inference latency.
  Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce the latency
  by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve inferior accuracy
  compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due to a difficulty in
  dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation. This paper proposes a new
  approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in a unified Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model learns to approximate the regularized
  posterior of the NAR model. In the M-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior
  and selects the training examples for the next AR model. This iterative process
  can effectively guide the system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences.
  To our knowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation. We evaluate
  our method on the task of machine translation. Experimental results on benchmark
  data sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if not better, performance
  with existing NAR models and significantly reduces the inference latency.
