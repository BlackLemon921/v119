abstract: For deploying a deep learning model into production, it needs to be both
  accurate and compact to meet the latency and memory constraints. This usually results
  in a network that is deep (to ensure performance) and yet thin (to improve computational
  efficiency). In this paper, we propose an efficient method to train a deep thin
  network with a theoretic guarantee. Our method is motivated by model compression.
  It consists of three stages. First, we sufficiently widen the deep thin network
  and train it until convergence. Then, we use this well-trained deep wide network
  to warm up (or initialize) the original deep thin network. This is achieved by layerwise
  imitation, that is, forcing the thin network to mimic the intermediate outputs of
  the wide network from layer to layer. Finally, we further fine tune this already
  well-initialized deep thin network. The theoretical guarantee is established by
  using the neural mean field analysis. It demonstrates the advantage of our layerwise
  imitation approach over backpropagation. We also conduct large-scale empirical experiments
  to validate the proposed method. By training with our method, ResNet50 can outperform
  ResNet101, and BERT base can be comparable with BERT large, when ResNet101 and BERT
  large are trained under the standard training procedures as in the literature.
