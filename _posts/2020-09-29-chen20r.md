abstract: Derivative-free optimization (DFO) has recently gained a lot of momentum
  in machine learning, spawning interest in the community to design faster methods
  for problems where gradients are not accessible. While some attention has been given
  to the concept of acceleration in the DFO literature, existing stochastic algorithms
  for objective functions with a finite-sum structure have not been shown theoretically
  to achieve an accelerated rate of convergence. Algorithms that use acceleration
  in such a setting are prone to instabilities, making it difficult to reach convergence.
  In this work, we exploit the finite-sum structure of the objective in order to design
  a variance-reduced DFO algorithm that provably yields acceleration. We prove rates
  of convergence for both smooth convex and strongly-convex finite-sum objective functions.
  Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on several tasks and datasets.
