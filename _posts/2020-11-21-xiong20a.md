abstract: One fundamental problem in deep learning is understanding the outstanding
  performance of deep Neural Networks (NNs) in practice. One explanation for the superiority
  of NNs is that they can realize a large class of complicated functions, i.e., they
  have powerful expressivity. The expressivity of a ReLU NN can be quantified by the
  maximal number of linear regions it can separate its input space into. In this paper,
  we provide several mathematical results needed for studying the linear regions of
  CNNs, and use them to derive the maximal and average numbers of linear regions for
  one-layer ReLU CNNs. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number
  of linear regions of multi-layer ReLU CNNs. Our results suggest that deeper CNNs
  have more powerful expressivity than their shallow counterparts, while CNNs have
  more expressivity than fully-connected NNs per parameter.
