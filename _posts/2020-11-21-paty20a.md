abstract: Regularizing the optimal transport (OT) problem has proven crucial for OT
  theory to impact the field of machine learning. For instance, it is known that regularizing
  OT problems with entropy leads to faster computations and better differentiation
  using the Sinkhorn algorithm, as well as better sample complexity bounds than classic
  OT. In this work we depart from this practical perspective and propose a new interpretation
  of regularization as a robust mechanism, and show using Fenchel duality that any
  convex regularization of OT can be interpreted as ground cost adversarial. This
  incidentally gives access to a robust dissimilarity measure on the ground space,
  which can in turn be used in other applications. We propose algorithms to compute
  this robust cost, and illustrate the interest of this approach empirically.
