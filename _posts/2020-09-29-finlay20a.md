abstract: Training neural ODEs on large datasets has not been tractable due to the
  necessity of allowing the adaptive numerical ODE solver to refine its step size
  to very small values. In practice this leads to dynamics equivalent to many hundreds
  or even thousands of layers. In this paper, we overcome this apparent difficulty
  by introducing a theoretically-grounded combination of both optimal transport and
  stability regularizations which encourage neural ODEs to prefer simpler dynamics
  out of all the dynamics that solve a problem well. Simpler dynamics lead to faster
  convergence and to fewer discretizations of the solver, considerably decreasing
  wall-clock time without loss in performance. Our approach allows us to train neural
  ODE-based generative models to the same performance as the unregularized dynamics,
  with significant reductions in training time. This brings neural ODEs closer to
  practical relevance in large-scale applications.
