abstract: We consider a decentralized stochastic learning problem where data points
  are distributed among computing nodes communicating over a directed graph. As the
  model size gets large, decentralized learning faces a major bottleneck that is the
  heavy communication load due to each node transmitting large messages (model updates)
  to its neighbors. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose the quantized decentralized
  stochastic learning algorithm over directed graphs that is based on the push-sum
  algorithm in decentralized consensus optimization. We prove that our algorithm achieves
  the same convergence rates of the decentralized stochastic learning algorithm with
  exact-communication for both convex and non-convex losses. Numerical evaluations
  corroborate our main theoretical results and illustrate significant speed-up compared
  to the exact-communication methods.
