abstract: We design and analyze CascadeBAI, an algorithm for finding the best set
  of K items, also called an arm, within the framework of cascading bandits. An upper
  bound on the time complexity of CascadeBAI is derived by overcoming a crucial analytical
  challenge, namely, that of probabilistically estimating the amount of available
  feedback at each step. To do so, we define a new class of random variables (r.v.’s)
  which we term as left-sided sub-Gaussian r.v.’s; this class is a relaxed version
  of the sub-Gaussian r.v.’s. This enables the application of a sufficiently tight
  Bernstein-type concentration inequality. We show, through the derivation of a lower
  bound on the time complexity, that the performance of CascadeBAI is optimal in some
  practical regimes. Finally, extensive numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy
  of CascadeBAI as well as the tightness of our upper bound on its time complexity.
