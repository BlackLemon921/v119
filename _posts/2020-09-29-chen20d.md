abstract: 'In this paper, we study combinatorial pure exploration for dueling bandits
  (CPE-DB): we have multiple candidates for multiple positions as modeled by a bipartite
  graph, and in each round we sample a duel of two candidates on one position and
  observe who wins in the duel, with the goal of finding the best candidate-position
  matching with high probability after multiple rounds of samples. CPE-DB is an adaptation
  of the original combinatorial pure exploration for multi-armed bandit (CPE-MAB)
  problem to the dueling bandit setting. We consider both the Borda winner and the
  Condorcet winner cases. For Borda winner, we establish a reduction of the problem
  to the original CPE-MAB setting and design PAC and exact algorithms that achieve
  both the sample complexity similar to that in the CPE-MAB setting (which is nearly
  optimal for a subclass of problems) and polynomial running time per round. For Condorcet
  winner, we first design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for
  the offline problem of finding the Condorcet winner with known winning probabilities,
  and then use the FPTAS as an oracle to design a novel pure exploration algorithm
  CAR-Cond with sample complexity analysis. CAR-Cond is the first algorithm with polynomial
  running time per round for identifying the Condorcet winner in CPE-DB.'
