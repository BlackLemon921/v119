abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) aims to extract patterns using self-expressive
  decomposition of data as convex combinations of extremal points (on the convex hull)
  of the data. This work presents a computationally efficient greedy AA (GAA) algorithm.
  GAA leverages the underlying geometry of AA, is scalable to larger datasets, and
  has significantly faster convergence rate. To achieve this, archetypes are learned
  via sparse projection of data. In the transformed space, GAA employs an iterative
  subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex
  representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended
  AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is considerably
  faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classification,
  data visualization/categorization.
