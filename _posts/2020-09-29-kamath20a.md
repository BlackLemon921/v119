abstract: 'The goal of compressed sensing is to learn a structured signal $x$ from
  a limited number of noisy linear measurements $y \approx Ax$. In traditional compressed
  sensing, “structure” is represented by sparsity in some known basis. Inspired by
  the success of deep learning in modeling images, recent work starting with Bora-Jalal-Price-Dimakis’17
  has instead considered structure to come from a generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k
  \to \mathbb{R}^n$. We present two results establishing the difficulty and strength
  of this latter task, showing that existing bounds are tight: First, we provide a
  lower bound matching the Bora et.al upper bound for compressed sensing with $L$-Lipschitz
  generative models $G$ which holds even for the more relaxed goal of \emph{non-uniform}
  recovery. Second, we show that generative models generalize sparsity as a representation
  of structure by constructing a ReLU-based neural network with $2$ hidden layers
  and $O(n)$ activations per layer whose range is precisely the set of all $k$-sparse
  vectors.'
