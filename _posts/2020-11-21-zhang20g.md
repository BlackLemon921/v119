abstract: Recent encoder-decoder approaches typically employ string decoders to convert
  images into serialized strings for image-to-markup. However, for tree-structured
  representational markup, string representations can hardly cope with the structural
  complexity. In this work, we first show via a set of toy problems that string decoders
  struggle to decode tree structures, especially as structural complexity increases,
  we then propose a tree-structured decoder that specifically aims at generating a
  tree-structured markup. Our decoders works sequentially, where at each step a child
  node and its parent node are simultaneously generated to form a sub-tree. This sub-tree
  is consequently used to construct the final tree structure in a recurrent manner.
  Key to the success of our tree decoder is twofold, (i) it strictly respects the
  parent-child relationship of trees, and (ii) it explicitly outputs trees as oppose
  to a linear string. Evaluated on both math formula recognition and chemical formula
  recognition, the proposed tree decoder is shown to greatly outperform strong string
  decoder baselines.
