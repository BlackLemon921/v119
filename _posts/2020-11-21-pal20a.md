abstract: Mixture of linear regressions is a popular learning theoretic model that
  is used widely to represent heterogeneous data. In the simplest form, this model
  assumes that the labels are generated from either of two different linear models
  and mixed together. Recent works of Yin et al. and Krishnamurthy et al., 2019, focus
  on an experimental design setting of model recovery for this problem. It is assumed
  that the features can be designed and queried with to obtain their label. When queried,
  an oracle randomly selects one of the two different sparse linear models and generates
  a label accordingly. How many such oracle queries are needed to recover both of
  the models simultaneously? This question can also be thought of as a generalization
  of the well-known compressed sensing problem (Cand√®s and Tao, 2005, Donoho, 2006).
  In this work we address this query complexity problem and provide efficient algorithms
  that improves on the previously best known results.
