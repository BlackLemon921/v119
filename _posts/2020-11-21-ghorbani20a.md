abstract: Shapley value is a classic notion from game theory, historically used to
  quantify the contributions of individuals within groups, and more recently applied
  to assign values to data points when training machine learning models. Despite its
  foundational role, a key limitation of the data Shapley framework is that it only
  provides valuations for points within a fixed data set. It does not account for
  statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to reason about points outside
  the data set. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework – distributional
  Shapley– where the value of a point is defined in the context of an underlying data
  distribution. We prove that distributional Shapley has several desirable statistical
  properties; for example, the values are stable under perturbations to the data points
  themselves and to the underlying data distribution. We leverage these properties
  to develop a new algorithm for estimating values from data, which comes with formal
  guarantees and runs two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art algorithms
  for computing the (non distributional) data Shapley values. We apply distributional
  Shapley to diverse data sets and demonstrate its utility in a data market setting.
