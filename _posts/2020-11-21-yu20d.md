abstract: Imitation learning in a high-dimensional environment is challenging. Most
  inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods fail to outperform the demonstrator
  in such a high-dimensional environment, e.g., Atari domain. To address this challenge,
  we propose a novel reward learning module to generate intrinsic reward signals via
  a generative model. Our generative method can perform better forward state transition
  and backward action encoding, which improves the moduleâ€™s dynamics modeling ability
  in the environment. Thus, our module provides the imitation agent both the intrinsic
  intention of the demonstrator and a better exploration ability, which is critical
  for the agent to outperform the demonstrator. Empirical results show that our method
  outperforms state-of-the-art IRL methods on multiple Atari games, even with one-life
  demonstration. Remarkably, our method achieves performance that is up to 5 times
  the performance of the demonstration.
