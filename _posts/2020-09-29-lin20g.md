abstract: 'Decision tree optimization is notoriously difficult from a computational
  perspective but essential for the field of interpretable machine learning. Despite
  efforts over the past 40 years, only recently have optimization breakthroughs been
  made that have allowed practical algorithms to find optimal decision trees. These
  new techniques have the potential to trigger a paradigm shift, where, it is possible
  to construct sparse decision trees to efficiently optimize a variety of objective
  functions, without relying on greedy splitting and pruning heuristics that often
  lead to suboptimal solutions. The contribution in this work is to provide a general
  framework for decision tree optimization that addresses the two significant open
  problems in the area: treatment of imbalanced data and fully optimizing over continuous
  variables. We present techniques that produce optimal decision trees over variety
  of objectives including F-score, AUC, and partial area under the ROC convex hull.
  We also introduce a scalable algorithm that produces provably optimal results in
  the presence of continuous variables and speeds up decision tree construction by
  several order of magnitude relative to the state-of-the art.'
