abstract: Stochastic neural networks with discrete random variables are an important
  class of models for their expressiveness and interpretability. Since direct differentiation
  and backpropagation is not possible, Monte Carlo gradient estimation techniques
  are a popular alternative. Efficient stochastic gradient estimators, such Straight-Through
  and Gumbel-Softmax, work well for shallow stochastic models. Their performance,
  however, suffers with hierarchical, more complex models. We focus on stochastic
  networks with Boolean latent variables. To analyze such networks, we introduce the
  framework of harmonic analysis for Boolean functions to derive an analytic formulation
  for the bias and variance in the Straight-Through estimator. Exploiting these formulations,
  we propose \emph{FouST}, a low-bias and low-variance gradient estimation algorithm
  that is just as efficient. Extensive experiments show that FouST performs favorably
  compared to state-of-the-art biased estimators and is much faster than unbiased
  ones.
