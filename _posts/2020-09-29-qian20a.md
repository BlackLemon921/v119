abstract: 'Speech information can be roughly decomposed into four components: language
  content, timbre, pitch, and rhythm. Obtaining disentangled representations of these
  components is useful in many speech analysis and generation applications. Recently,
  state-of-the-art voice conversion systems have led to speech representations that
  can disentangle speaker-dependent and independent information. However, these systems
  can only disentangle timbre, while information about pitch, rhythm and content is
  still mixed together. Further disentangling the remaining speech components is an
  under-determined problem in the absence of explicit annotations for each component,
  which are difficult and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose SpeechSplit,
  which can blindly decompose speech into its four components by introducing three
  carefully designed information bottlenecks. SpeechSplit is among the first algorithms
  that can separately perform style transfer on timbre, pitch and rhythm without text
  labels. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/auspicious3000/SpeechSplit.'
