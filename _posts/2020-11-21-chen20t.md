abstract: We introduce Negative Sampling in Semi-Supervised Learning (NS^3L), a simple,
  fast, easy to tune algorithm for semi-supervised learning (SSL). NS^3L is motivated
  by the success of negative sampling/contrastive estimation. We demonstrate that
  adding the NS^3L loss to state-of-the-art SSL algorithms, such as the Virtual Adversarial
  Training (VAT), significantly improves upon vanilla VAT and its variant, VAT with
  Entropy Minimization. By adding the NS^3L loss to MixMatch, the current state-of-the-art
  approach on semi-supervised tasks, we observe significant improvements over vanilla
  MixMatch. We conduct extensive experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and STL10
  benchmark datasets. Finally, we perform an ablation study for NS3L regarding its
  hyperparameter tuning.
