abstract: The standard risk minimization paradigm of machine learning is brittle when
  operating in environments whose test distributions are different from the training
  distribution due to spurious correlations. Training on data from many environments
  and finding invariant predictors reduces the effect of spurious features by concentrating
  models on features that have a causal relationship with the outcome. In this work,
  we pose such invariant risk minimization as finding the Nash equilibrium of an ensemble
  game among several environments. By doing so, we develop a simple training algorithm
  that uses best response dynamics and, in our experiments, yields similar or better
  empirical accuracy with much lower variance than the challenging bi-level optimization
  problem of Arjovsky et al. (2019). One key theoretical contribution is showing that
  the set of Nash equilibria for the proposed game are equivalent to the set of invariant
  predictors for any finite number of environments, even with nonlinear classifiers
  and transformations. As a result, our method also retains the generalization guarantees
  to a large set of environments shown in Arjovsky et al. (2019). The proposed algorithm
  adds to the collection of successful game-theoretic machine learning algorithms
  such as generative adversarial networks.
