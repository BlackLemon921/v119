abstract: Efficient and interpretable spatial analysis is crucial in many fields such
  as geology, sports, and climate science. Tensor latent factor models can describe
  higher-order correlations for spatial data. However, they are computationally expensive
  to train and are sensitive to initialization, leading to spatially incoherent, uninterpretable
  results. We develop a novel Multiresolution Tensor Learning (MRTL) algorithm for
  efficiently learning interpretable spatial patterns. MRTL initializes the latent
  factors from an approximate full-rank tensor model for improved interpretability
  and progressively learns from a coarse resolution to the fine resolution to reduce
  computation. We also prove the theoretical convergence and computational complexity
  of MRTL. When applied to two real-world datasets, MRTL demonstrates 4Â 5x speedup
  compared to a fixed resolution approach while yielding accurate and interpretable
  latent factors.
