abstract: Online recommender systems often face long delays in receiving feedback,
  especially when optimizing for some long-term metrics. While mitigating the effects
  of delays in learning is well-understood in stationary environments, the problem
  becomes much more challenging when the environment changes. In fact, if the timescale
  of the change is comparable to the delay, it is impossible to learn about the environment,
  since the available observations are already obsolete. However, the arising issues
  can be addressed if intermediate signals are available without delay, such that
  given those signals, the long-term behavior of the system is stationary. To model
  this situation, we introduce the problem of stochastic, non-stationary, delayed
  bandits with intermediate observations. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm
  based on UCRL, and prove sublinear regret guarantees for its performance. Experimental
  results demonstrate that our method is able to learn in non-stationary delayed environments
  where existing methods fail.
