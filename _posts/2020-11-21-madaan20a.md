abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of deep neural networks on various computer
  vision tasks, they are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which
  makes it challenging to deploy them in real-world safety-critical applications.
  In this paper, we conjecture that the leading cause of adversarial vulnerability
  is the distortion in the latent feature space, and provide methods to suppress them
  effectively. Explicitly, we define \emph{vulnerability} for each latent feature
  and then propose a new loss for adversarial learning, \emph{Vulnerability Suppression
  (VS)} loss, that aims to minimize the feature-level vulnerability during training.
  We further propose a Bayesian framework to prune features with high vulnerability
  to reduce both vulnerability and loss on adversarial samples. We validate our \emph{Adversarial
  Neural Pruning with Vulnerability Suppression (ANP-VS)} method on multiple benchmark
  datasets, on which it not only obtains state-of-the-art adversarial robustness but
  also improves the performance on clean examples, using only a fraction of the parameters
  used by the full network. Further qualitative analysis suggests that the improvements
  come from the suppression of feature-level vulnerability.
