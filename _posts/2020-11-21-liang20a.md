abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned
  from a labeled source dataset to solve similar tasks in a new unlabeled domain.
  Prior UDA methods typically require to access the source data when learning to adapt
  the model, making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. This
  work tackles a practical setting where only a trained source model is available
  and investigates how we can effectively utilize such a model without source data
  to solve UDA problems. We propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework,
  named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). SHOT freezes the classifier module
  (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction
  module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling
  to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis.
  To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including
  closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that
  SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks.
