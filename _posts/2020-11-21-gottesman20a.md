abstract: 'Off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning offers the chance of using
  observational data to improve future outcomes in domains such as healthcare and
  education, but safe deployment in high stakes settings requires ways of assessing
  its validity. Traditional measures such as confidence intervals may be insufficient
  due to noise, limited data and confounding. In this paper we develop a method that
  could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human experts to analyze the
  validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is accomplished by highlighting observations
  in the data whose removal will have a large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating
  a set of rules for choosing which ones to present to domain experts for validation.
  We develop methods to compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation
  with two different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares, as well
  as importance sampling methods. Experiments on medical simulations and real-world
  intensive care unit data demonstrate that our method can be used to identify limitations
  in the evaluation process and make evaluation more robust.'
