abstract: In this paper, we study the leading eigenvector problem in a statistically
  distributed setting and propose a communication-efficient algorithm based on Riemannian
  optimization, which trades local computation for global communication. Theoretical
  analysis shows that the proposed algorithm linearly converges to the centralized
  empirical risk minimization solution regarding the number of communication rounds.
  When the number of data points in local machines is sufficiently large, the proposed
  algorithm achieves a significant reduction of communication cost over existing distributed
  PCA algorithms. Superior performance in terms of communication cost of the proposed
  algorithm is verified on real-world and synthetic datasets.
