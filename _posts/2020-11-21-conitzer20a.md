abstract: We study the problem of learning opinions in social networks. The learner
  observes the states of some sample nodes from a social network, and tries to infer
  the states of other nodes, based on the structure of the network. We show that sample-efficient
  learning is impossible when the network exhibits strong noise, and give a polynomial-time
  algorithm for the problem with nearly optimal sample complexity when the network
  is sufficiently stable.
