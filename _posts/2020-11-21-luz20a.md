abstract: Efficient numerical solvers for sparse linear systems are crucial in science
  and engineering. One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse linear
  systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the construction of
  AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operatorâ€”a problem-dependent
  sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the solver and is critical
  to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this
  task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases.
  Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems
  with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph
  neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation
  operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad
  class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG,
  demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system
  solvers.
