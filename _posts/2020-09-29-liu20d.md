abstract: The goal of standard 1-bit compressive sensing is to accurately recover
  an unknown sparse vector from binary-valued measurements, each indicating the sign
  of a linear function of the vector. Motivated by recent advances in compressive
  sensing with generative models, where a generative modeling assumption replaces
  the usual sparsity assumption, we study the problem of 1-bit compressive sensing
  with generative models. We first consider noiseless 1-bit measurements, and provide
  sample complexity bounds for approximate recovery under i.i.d.Â Gaussian measurements
  and a Lipschitz continuous generative prior, as well as a near-matching algorithm-independent
  lower bound. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Binary $\epsilon$-Stable Embedding
  property, which characterizes the robustness of the reconstruction to measurement
  errors and noise, also holds for 1-bit compressive sensing with Lipschitz continuous
  generative models with sufficiently many Gaussian measurements. In addition, we
  apply our results to neural network generative models, and provide a proof-of-concept
  numerical experiment demonstrating significant improvements over sparsity-based
  approaches.
