abstract: To date, most state-of-the-art sequence modeling architectures use attention
  to build generative models for language based tasks. Some of these models use all
  the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which results
  in time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions
  with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention,
  resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\cdot}n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware
  Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns
  to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel
  matrix. This method yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence
  encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method
  on large-scale standard machine translation, abstractive summarization and language
  modeling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement
  over other attention/convolution based approaches.
