abstract: Survival Analysis and Reliability Theory are concerned with the analysis
  of time-to-event data, in which observations correspond to waiting times until an
  event of interest such as death from a particular disease or failure of a component
  in a mechanical system. This type of data is unique due to the presence of censoring,
  a type of missing data that occurs when we do not observe the actual time of the
  event of interest but, instead, we have access to an approximation for it given
  by random interval in which the observation is known to belong. Most traditional
  methods are not designed to deal with censoring, and thus we need to adapt them
  to censored time-to-event data. In this paper, we focus on non-parametric goodness-of-fit
  testing procedures based on combining the Steinâ€™s method and kernelized discrepancies.
  While for uncensored data, there is a natural way of implementing a kernelized Stein
  discrepancy test, for censored data there are several options, each of them with
  different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a collection of
  kernelized Stein discrepancy tests for time-to-event data, and we study each of
  them theoretically and empirically; our experimental results show that our proposed
  methods perform better than existing tests, including previous tests based on a
  kernelized maximum mean discrepancy.
