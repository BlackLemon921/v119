abstract: The ability to jointly understand the geometry of objects and plan actions
  for manipulating them is crucial for intelligent agents. We refer to this ability
  as geometric planning. Recently, many interactive environments have been proposed
  to evaluate intelligent agents on various skills, however, none of them cater to
  the needs of geometric planning. We present PackIt, a virtual environment to evaluate
  and potentially learn the ability to do geometric planning, where an agent needs
  to take a sequence of actions to pack a set of objects into a box with limited space.
  We also construct a set of challenging packing tasks using an evolutionary algorithm.
  Further, we study various baselines for the task that include model-free learning-based
  and heuristic-based methods, as well as search-based optimization methods that assume
  access to the model of the environment.
