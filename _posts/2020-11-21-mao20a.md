abstract: Adversarial Multi-task Representation Learning (AMTRL) methods are able
  to boost the performance of Multi-task Representation Learning (MTRL) models. However,
  the theoretical mechanism behind AMTRL is less investigated. To fill this gap, we
  study the generalization error bound of AMTRL through the lens of Lagrangian duality
  . Based on the duality, we proposed an novel adaptive AMTRL algorithm which improves
  the performance of original AMTRL methods. The extensive experiments back up our
  theoretical analysis and validate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.
