abstract: Standard RL algorithms assume fixed environment dynamics and require a significant
  amount of interaction to adapt to new environments. We introduce Policy-Dynamics
  Value Functions (PD-VF), a novel approach for rapidly adapting to dynamics different
  from those previously seen in training. PD-VF explicitly estimates the cumulative
  reward in a space of policies and environments. An ensemble of conventional RL policies
  is used to gather experience on training environments, from which embeddings of
  both policies and environments can be learned. Then, a value function conditioned
  on both embeddings is trained. At test time, a few actions are sufficient to infer
  the environment embedding, enabling a policy to be selected by maximizing the learned
  value function (which requires no additional environment interaction). We show that
  our method can rapidly adapt to new dynamics on a set of MuJoCo domains.
