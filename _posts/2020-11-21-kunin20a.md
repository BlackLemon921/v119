abstract: 'The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily
  for its use of non-local weight transport â€” the biologically dubious requirement
  that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of another. Until recently,
  attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically
  failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g.
  ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a
  recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation
  and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious
  tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates
  the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify
  a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning.
  Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and
  backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several
  non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport
  into a more biologically-plausible "weight estimation" process, showing that these
  rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively
  in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes
  towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight
  symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across
  architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local
  learning mechanisms.'
