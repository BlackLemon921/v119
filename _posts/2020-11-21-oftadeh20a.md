abstract: This paper proposes a new loss function for linear autoencoders (LAEs) and
  analytically identifies the structure of the associated loss surface. Optimizing
  the conventional Mean Square Error (MSE) loss results in a decoder matrix that spans
  the principal subspace of the sample covariance of the data, but, owing to an invariance
  that cancels out in the global map, it will fail to identify the exact eigenvectors.
  We show here that our proposed loss function eliminates this issue, so the decoder
  converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance
  matrix. We characterize the full structure of the new loss landscape by establishing
  an analytical expression for the set of all critical points, showing that it is
  a subset of critical points of MSE, and that all local minima are still global.
  Specifically, the invariant global minima under MSE are shown to become saddle points
  under the new loss. Additionally, the computational complexity of the loss and its
  gradients are the same as MSE and, thus, the new loss is not only of theoretical
  importance but is of practical value, e.g., for low-rank approximation.
