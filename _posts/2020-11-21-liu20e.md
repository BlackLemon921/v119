abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a common challenge in supervised learning.
  Existing approaches often require practitioners to specify noise rates, i.e., a
  set of parameters controlling the severity of label noises in the problem, and the
  specifications are either assumed to be given or estimated using additional steps.
  In this work, we introduce a new family of loss functions that we name as peer loss
  functions, which enables learning from noisy labels and does not require a priori
  specification of the noise rates. Peer loss functions work within the standard empirical
  risk minimization (ERM) framework. We show that, under mild conditions, performing
  ERM with peer loss functions on the noisy data leads to the optimal or a near-optimal
  classifier as if performing ERM over the clean training data, which we do not have
  access to. We pair our results with an extensive set of experiments. Peer loss provides
  a way to simplify model development when facing potentially noisy training labels,
  and can be promoted as a robust candidate loss function in such situations.
