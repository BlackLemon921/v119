abstract: Stochastic particle-optimization sampling (SPOS) is a recently-developed
  scalable Bayesian sampling framework unifying stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC)
  and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) algorithms based on Wasserstein gradient
  flows. With a rigorous non-asymptotic convergence theory developed, SPOS can avoid
  the particle-collapsing pitfall of SVGD. However, the variance-reduction effect
  in SPOS has not been clear. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting several
  variance-reduction techniques for SPOS. Specifically, we propose three variants
  of variance-reduced SPOS, called SAGA particle-optimization sampling (SAGA-POS),
  SVRG particle-optimization sampling (SVRG-POS) and a variant of SVRG-POS which avoids
  full gradient computations, denoted as SVRG-POS$^+$. Importantly, we provide non-asymptotic
  convergence guarantees for these algorithms in terms of the 2-Wasserstein metric
  and analyze their complexities. The results show our algorithms yield better convergence
  rates than existing variance-reduced variants of stochastic Langevin dynamics, though
  more space is required to store the particles in training. Our theory aligns well
  with experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.
