abstract: 'In real world, our datasets often contain outliers. Most existing algorithms
  for handling outliers take high time complexities (\emph{e.g.} quadratic or cubic
  complexity). \emph{Coreset} is a popular approach for compressing data so as to
  speed up the optimization algorithms. However, the current coreset methods cannot
  be easily extended to handle the case with outliers. In this paper, we propose a
  new variant of coreset technique, \emph{layered sampling}, to deal with two fundamental
  robust optimization problems: \emph{$k$-median/means clustering with outliers} and
  \emph{linear regression with outliers}. This new coreset method is in particular
  suitable to speed up the iterative algorithms (which often improve the solution
  within a local range) for those robust optimization problems.'
