abstract: 'Over-parameterization is ubiquitous nowadays in training neural networks
  to benefit both optimization in seeking global optima and generalization in reducing
  prediction error. However, compressive networks are desired in many real world applications
  and direct training of small networks may be trapped in local optima. In this paper,
  instead of pruning or distilling over-parameterized models to compressive ones,
  we propose a new approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces.
  Specifically, it generates a family of models from simple to complex ones that couples
  a pair of parameters to simultaneously train over-parameterized deep models and
  structural sparsity on weights of fully connected and convolutional layers. Such
  a differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, proposed as Deep structurally
  splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global convergence analysis
  in deep learning is established that from any initializations, algorithmic iterations
  converge to a critical point of empirical risks. Experimental evidence shows that
  DessiLBI achieve comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers
  in exploring the structural sparsity of several widely used backbones on the benchmark
  datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, DessiLBI unveils “winning tickets” in
  early epochs: the effective sparse structure with comparable test accuracy to fully
  trained over-parameterized models.'
