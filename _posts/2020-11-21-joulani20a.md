abstract: 'Recently there have been several attempts to extend Nesterov’s accelerated
  algorithm to smooth stochastic and variance-reduced optimization. In this paper,
  we show that there is a simpler approach to acceleration: applying optimistic online
  learning algorithms and querying the gradient oracle at the online average of the
  intermediate optimization iterates. In particular, we tighten a recent result of
  Cutkosky (2019) to demonstrate theoretically that online iterate averaging results
  in a reduced optimization gap, independently of the algorithm involved. We show
  that carefully combining this technique with existing generic optimistic online
  learning algorithms yields the optimal accelerated rates for optimizing strongly-convex
  and non-strongly-convex, possibly composite objectives, with deterministic as well
  as stochastic first-order oracles. We further extend this idea to variance-reduced
  optimization. Finally, we also provide “universal” algorithms that achieve the optimal
  rate for smooth and non-smooth composite objectives simultaneously without further
  tuning, generalizing the results of Kavis et al. (2019) and solving a number of
  their open problems.'
