abstract: The use of machine learning algorithms in finance, medicine, and criminal
  justice can deeply impact human lives. As a consequence, research into interpretable
  machine learning has rapidly grown in an attempt to better control and fix possible
  sources of mistakes and biases. Tree ensembles, in particular, offer a good prediction
  quality in various domains, but the concurrent use of multiple trees reduces the
  interpretability of the ensemble. Against this background, we study born-again tree
  ensembles, i.e., the process of constructing a single decision tree of minimum size
  that reproduces the exact same behavior as a given tree ensemble in its entire feature
  space. To find such a tree, we develop a dynamic-programming based algorithm that
  exploits sophisticated pruning and bounding rules to reduce the number of recursive
  calls. This algorithm generates optimal born-again trees for many datasets of practical
  interest, leading to classifiers which are typically simpler and more interpretable
  without any other form of compromise.
