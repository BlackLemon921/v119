abstract: Studying the set of exact solutions of a system of polynomial equations
  largely depends on a single iterative algorithm, known as Buchberger’s algorithm.
  Optimized versions of this algorithm are crucial for many computer algebra systems
  (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, Sage). We introduce a new approach to Buchberger’s algorithm
  that uses reinforcement learning agents to perform S-pair selection, a key step
  in the algorithm. We then study how the difficulty of the problem depends on the
  choices of domain and distribution of polynomials, about which little is known.
  Finally, we train a policy model using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to learn
  S-pair selection strategies for random systems of binomial equations. In certain
  domains, the trained model outperforms state-of-the-art selection heuristics in
  total number of polynomial additions performed, which provides a proof-of-concept
  that recent developments in machine learning have the potential to improve performance
  of algorithms in symbolic computation.
