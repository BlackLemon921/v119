abstract: This paper studies few-shot relation extraction, which aims at predicting
  the relation for a pair of entities in a sentence by training with a few labeled
  examples in each relation. To more effectively generalize to new relations, in this
  paper we study the relationships between different relations and propose to leverage
  a global relation graph. We propose a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach to effectively
  learn the posterior distribution of the prototype vectors of relations, where the
  initial prior of the prototype vectors is parameterized with a graph neural network
  on the global relation graph. Moreover, to effectively optimize the posterior distribution
  of the prototype vectors, we propose to use the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics,
  which is related to the MAML algorithm but is able to handle the uncertainty of
  the prototype vectors. The whole framework can be effectively and efficiently optimized
  in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on two benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness
  of our proposed approach against competitive baselines in both the few-shot and
  zero-shot settings.
