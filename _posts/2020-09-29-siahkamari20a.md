abstract: We present a new piecewise linear regression methodology that utilises fitting
  a \emph{difference of convex} functions (DC functions) to the data. These are functions
  $f$ that may be represented as the difference $\phi_1 - \phi_2$ for a choice of
  \emph{convex} functions $\phi_1, \phi_2$. The method proceeds by estimating piecewise-liner
  convex functions, in a manner similar to max-affine regression, whose difference
  approximates the data. The choice of the function is regularised by a new seminorm
  over the class of DC functions that controls the $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz constant
  of the estimate. The resulting methodology can be efficiently implemented via Quadratic
  programming \emph{even in high dimensions}, and is shown to have close to minimax
  statistical risk. We empirically validate the method, showing it to be practically
  implementable, and to outperform existing regression methods in accuracy on real-world
  datasets.
