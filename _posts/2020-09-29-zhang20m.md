abstract: Learning controllable and generalizable representation of multivariate data
  with desired structural properties remains a fundamental problem in machine learning.
  In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning generative models with
  various underlying structures in the latent space. Learning controllable and generalizable
  representation of multivariate data with desired structural properties remains a
  fundamental problem in machine learning. In this paper, we present a novel framework
  for learning generative models with various underlying structures in the latent
  space. We represent the inductive bias in the form of mask variables to model the
  dependency structure in the graphical model and extend the theory of multivariate
  information bottleneck (Friedman et al., 2001) to enforce it. Our model provides
  a principled approach to learn a set of semantically meaningful latent factors that
  reflect various types of desired structures like capturing correlation or encoding
  invariance, while also offering the flexibility to automatically estimate the dependency
  structure from data. We show that our framework unifies many existing generative
  models and can be applied to a variety of tasks, including multimodal data modeling,
  algorithmic fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization.
