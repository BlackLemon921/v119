abstract: Distribution shift is a major obstacle to the deployment of current deep
  learning models on real-world problems. Let $Y$ be the class label and $X$ the features.
  We focus on one type of distribution shift, \emph{ label shift}, where the label
  marginal distribution $P_Y$ changes but the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y}$ does
  not. Most existing methods estimate the density ratio between the source- and target-domain
  label distributions by density matching. However, these methods are either computationally
  infeasible for large-scale data or restricted to shift correction for discrete labels.
  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Label Transformation Framework (LTF) for
  correcting label shift, which implicitly models the shift of $P_Y$ and the conditional
  distribution $P_{X|Y}$ using neural networks. Thanks to the flexibility of deep
  networks, our framework can handle continuous, discrete, and even multi-dimensional
  labels in a unified way and is scalable to large data. Moreover, for high dimensional
  $X$, such as images, we find that the redundant information in $X$ severely degrades
  the estimation accuracy. To remedy this issue, we propose to match the distribution
  implied by our generative model and the target-domain distribution in a low-dimensional
  feature space that discards information irrelevant to $Y$. Both theoretical and
  empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches.
