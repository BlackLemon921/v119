abstract: Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is a task for tagging a given
  text with the most relevant labels from an extremely large label set. We propose
  a novel deep learning method called APLC-XLNet. Our approach fine-tunes the recently
  released generalized autoregressive pretrained model (XLNet) to learn a dense representation
  for the input text. We propose Adaptive Probabilistic Label Clusters (APLC) to approximate
  the cross entropy loss by exploiting the unbalanced label distribution to form clusters
  that explicitly reduce the computational time. Our experiments, carried out on five
  benchmark datasets, show that our approach has achieved new state-of-the-art results
  on four benchmark datasets. Our source code is available publicly at https://github.com/huiyegit/APLC_XLNet.
