abstract: 'Classical linear metric learning methods have recently been extended along
  two distinct lines: deep metric learning methods for learning embeddings of the
  data using neural networks, and Bregman divergence learning approaches for extending
  learning Euclidean distances to more general divergence measures such as divergences
  over distributions. In this paper, we introduce deep Bregman divergences, which
  are based on learning and parameterizing functional Bregman divergences using neural
  networks, and which unify and extend these existing lines of work. We show in particular
  how deep metric learning formulations, kernel metric learning, Mahalanobis metric
  learning, and moment-matching functions for comparing distributions arise as special
  cases of these divergences in the symmetric setting. We then describe a deep learning
  framework for learning general functional Bregman divergences, and show in experiments
  that this method yields superior performance on benchmark datasets as compared to
  existing deep metric learning approaches. We also discuss novel applications, including
  a semi-supervised distributional clustering problem, and a new loss function for
  unsupervised data generation.'
