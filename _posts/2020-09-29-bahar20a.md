abstract: 'Recommendation systems often face exploration-exploitation tradeoffs: the
  system can only learn about the desirability of new options by recommending them
  to some user. Such systems can thus be modeled as multi-armed bandit settings; however,
  users are self-interested and cannot be made to follow recommendations. We ask whether
  exploration can nevertheless be performed in a way that scrupulously respects agents’
  interests—i.e., by a system that acts as a fiduciary. More formally, we introduce
  a model in which a recommendation system faces an exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  under the constraint that it can never recommend any action that it knows yields
  lower reward in expectation than an agent would achieve if it acted alone. Our main
  contribution is a positive result: an asymptotically optimal, incentive compatible,
  and ex-ante individually rational recommendation algorithm.'
