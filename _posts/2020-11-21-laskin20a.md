abstract: 'We present CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement
  Learning. CURL extracts high-level features from raw pixels using contrastive learning
  and performs off-policy control on top of the extracted features. CURL outperforms
  prior pixel-based methods, both model-based and model-free, on complex tasks in
  the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Games showing 1.9x and 1.2x performance gains
  at the 100K environment and interaction steps benchmarks respectively. On the DeepMind
  Control Suite, CURL is the first image-based algorithm to nearly match the sample-efficiency
  of methods that use state-based features. Our code is open-sourced and available
  at https://www.github.com/MishaLaskin/curl.'
