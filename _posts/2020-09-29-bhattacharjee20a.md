abstract: A growing body of research has shown that many classifiers are susceptible
  to adversarial examples – small strategic modifications to test inputs that lead
  to misclassification. In this work, we study general non-parametric methods, with
  a view towards understanding when they are robust to these modifications. We establish
  general conditions under which non-parametric methods are r-consistent – in the
  sense that they converge to optimally robust and accurate classifiers in the large
  sample limit. Concretely, our results show that when data is well-separated, nearest
  neighbors and kernel classifiers are r-consistent, while histograms are not. For
  general data distributions, we prove that preprocessing by Adversarial Pruning (Yang
  et. al., 2019)– that makes data well-separated – followed by nearest neighbors or
  kernel classifiers also leads to r-consistency.
