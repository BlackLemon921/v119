abstract: A common workflow in data exploration is to learn a low-dimensional representation
  of the data, identify groups of points in that representation, and examine the differences
  between the groups to determine what they represent. We treat this workflow as an
  interpretable machine learning problem by leveraging the model that learned the
  low-dimensional representation to help identify the key differences between the
  groups. To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of explanation, a Global
  Counterfactual Explanation (GCE), and our algorithm, Transitive Global Translations
  (TGT), for computing GCEs. TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups
  using compressed sensing but constrains those pairwise differences to be consistent
  among all of the groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that TGT is able to identify
  explanations that accurately explain the model while being relatively sparse, and
  that these explanations match real patterns in the data.
