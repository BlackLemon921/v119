abstract: 'Un-trained convolutional neural networks have emerged as highly successful
  tools for image recovery and restoration. They are capable of solving standard inverse
  problems such as denoising and compressive sensing with excellent results by simply
  fitting a neural network model to measurements from a single image or signal without
  the need for any additional training data. For some applications, this critically
  requires additional regularization in the form of early stopping the optimization.
  For signal recovery from a few measurements, however, un-trained convolutional networks
  have an intriguing self-regularizing property: Even though the network can perfectly
  fit any image, the network recovers a natural image from few measurements when trained
  with gradient descent until convergence. In this paper, we provide numerical evidence
  for this property and study it theoretically. We show that—without any further regularization—an
  un-trained convolutional neural network can approximately reconstruct signals and
  images that are sufficiently structured, from a near minimal number of random measurements.'
