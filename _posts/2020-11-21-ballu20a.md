abstract: Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows
  to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects.
  Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss
  between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine
  learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized
  versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques
  require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss,
  thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require
  many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve
  a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per
  step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a
  dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed
  directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each
  step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show
  that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein
  barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of
  our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data.
