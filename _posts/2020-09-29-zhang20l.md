abstract: We consider the problem of learning Markov Random Fields (including the
  prototypical example, the Ising model) under the constraint of differential privacy.
  Our learning goals include both \emph{structure learning}, where we try to estimate
  the underlying graph structure of the model, as well as the harder goal of \emph{parameter
  learning}, in which we additionally estimate the parameter on each edge. We provide
  algorithms and lower bounds for both problems under a variety of privacy constraints
  â€“ namely pure, concentrated, and approximate differential privacy. While non-privately,
  both learning goals enjoy roughly the same complexity, we show that this is not
  the case under differential privacy. In particular, only structure learning under
  approximate differential privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic dependence
  on the dimensionality of the data, while a change in either the learning goal or
  the privacy notion would necessitate a polynomial dependence. As a result, we show
  that the privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning
  problems in the high-dimensional data regime.
