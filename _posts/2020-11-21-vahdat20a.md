abstract: The representation of the approximate posterior is a critical aspect of
  effective variational autoencoders (VAEs). Poor choices for the approximate posterior
  have a detrimental impact on the generative performance of VAEs due to the mismatch
  with the true posterior. We extend the class of posterior models that may be learned
  by using undirected graphical models. We develop an efficient method to train undirected
  approximate posteriors by showing that the gradient of the training objective with
  respect to the parameters of the undirected posterior can be computed by backpropagation
  through Markov chain Monte Carlo updates. We apply these gradient estimators for
  training discrete VAEs with Boltzmann machines as approximate posteriors and demonstrate
  that undirected models outperform previous results obtained using directed graphical
  models. Our implementation is publicly available.
