abstract: This paper proposes a new framework for providing approximation guarantees
  of local search algorithms. Local search is a basic algorithm design technique and
  is widely used for various combinatorial optimization problems. To analyze local
  search algorithms for set function maximization, we propose a new notion called
  \emph{localizability} of set functions, which measures how effective local improvement
  is. Moreover, we provide approximation guarantees of standard local search algorithms
  under various combinatorial constraints in terms of localizability. The main application
  of our framework is sparse optimization, for which we show that restricted strong
  concavity and restricted smoothness of the objective function imply localizability,
  and further develop accelerated versions of local search algorithms. We conduct
  experiments in sparse regression and structure learning of graphical models to confirm
  the practical efficiency of the proposed local search algorithms.
