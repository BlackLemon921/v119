abstract: We introduce the lookahead-bounded Q-learning (LBQL) algorithm, a new, provably
  convergent variant of Q-learning that seeks to improve the performance of standard
  Q-learning in stochastic environments through the use of “lookahead” upper and lower
  bounds. To do this, LBQL employs previously collected experience and each iteration’s
  state-action values as dual feasible penalties to construct a sequence of sampled
  information relaxation problems. The solutions to these problems provide estimated
  upper and lower bounds on the optimal value, which we track via stochastic approximation.
  These quantities are then used to constrain the iterates to stay within the bounds
  at every iteration. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems show that LBQL exhibits
  faster convergence and more robustness to hyperparameters when compared to standard
  Q-learning and several related techniques. Our approach is particularly appealing
  in problems that require expensive simulations or real-world interactions.
