abstract: The combination of Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement
  learning has led to groundbreaking results in artificial intelligence. However,
  AlphaZero, the current state-of-the-art MCTS algorithm still relies on handcrafted
  heuristics that are only partially understood. In this paper, we show that AlphaZero’s
  search heuristic, along with other common ones, can be interpreted as an approximation
  to the solution of a specific regularized policy optimization problem. With this
  insight, we propose a variant of AlphaZero which uses the exact solution to this
  policy optimization problem, and show experimentally that it reliably outperforms
  the original algorithm in multiple domains.
