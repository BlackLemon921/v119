abstract: In this paper, we focus on a theory-practice gap for Adam and its variants
  (AMSGrad, AdamNC, etc.). In practice, these algorithms are used with a constant
  first-order moment parameter $\beta_{1}$ (typically between $0.9$ and $0.99$). In
  theory, regret guarantees for online convex optimization require a rapidly decaying
  $\beta_{1}\to0$ schedule. We show that this is an artifact of the standard analysis,
  and we propose a novel framework that allows us to derive optimal, data-dependent
  regret bounds with a constant $\beta_{1}$, without further assumptions. We also
  demonstrate the flexibility of our analysis on a wide range of different algorithms
  and settings.
