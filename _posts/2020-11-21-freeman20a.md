abstract: We study online learning settings in which experts act strategically to
  maximize their influence on the learning algorithm’s predictions by potentially
  misreporting their beliefs about a sequence of binary events. Our goal is twofold.
  First, we want the learning algorithm to be no-regret with respect to the best-fixed
  expert in hindsight. Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each
  expert’s best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each
  event. To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms,
  a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret
  and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information
  settings. In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret
  comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible.
  Finally, we identify an incentive-compatible algorithm for forward-looking strategic
  agents that exhibits diminishing regret in practice.
