abstract: This paper employs a formal connection of machine learning with thermodynamics
  to characterize the quality of learnt representations for transfer learning. We
  discuss how information-theoretic functionals such as rate, distortion and classification
  loss of a model lie on a convex, so-called equilibrium surface. We prescribe dynamical
  processes to traverse this surface under constraints, e.g., an iso-classification
  process that trades off rate and distortion to keep the classification loss unchanged.
  We demonstrate how this process can be used for transferring representations from
  a source dataset to a target dataset while keeping the classification loss constant.
  Experimental validation of the theoretical results is provided on standard image-classification
  datasets.
