abstract: In this work we develop a novel Bayesian neural network methodology to achieve
  strong adversarial robustness without the need for online adversarial training.
  Unlike previous efforts in this direction, we do not rely solely on the stochasticity
  of network weights by minimizing the divergence between the learned parameter distribution
  and a prior. Instead, we additionally require that the model maintain some expected
  uncertainty with respect to all input covariates. We demonstrate that by encouraging
  the network to distribute evenly across inputs, the network becomes less susceptible
  to localized, brittle features which imparts a natural robustness to targeted perturbations.
  We show empirical robustness on several benchmark datasets.
