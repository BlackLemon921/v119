abstract: 'Representing shapes as level-sets of neural networks has been recently
  proved to be useful for different shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. So far,
  such representations were computed using either: (i) pre-computed implicit shape
  representations; or (ii) loss functions explicitly defined over the neural level-sets.
  In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural
  representations directly from raw data (i.e., point clouds, with or without normal
  information). We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural
  network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses
  an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero
  level-set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis
  of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads
  to state-of-the-art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details
  and fidelity compared to previous methods.'
