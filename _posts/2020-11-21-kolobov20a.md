abstract: 'Existing multi-armed bandit (MAB) models make two implicit assumptions:
  an arm generates a payoff only when it is played, and the agent observes every payoff
  that is generated. This paper introduces synchronization bandits, a MAB variant
  where all arms generate costs at all times, but the agent observes an armâ€™s instantaneous
  cost only when the arm is played. Synchronization MABs are inspired by online caching
  scenarios such as Web crawling, where an arm corresponds to a cached item and playing
  the arm means downloading its fresh copy from a server. We present MirrorSync, an
  online learning algorithm for synchronization bandits, establish an adversarial
  regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ for it, and show how to make it practical.'
