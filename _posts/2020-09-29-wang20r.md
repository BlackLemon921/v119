abstract: Recovering a signal from its Fourier intensity underlies many important
  applications, including lensless imaging and imaging through scattering media. Conventional
  algorithms for retrieving the phase suffer when noise is present but display global
  convergence when given clean data. Neural networks have been used to improve algorithm
  robustness, but efforts to date are sensitive to initial conditions and give inconsistent
  performance. Here, we combine iterative methods from phase retrieval with image
  statistics from deep denoisers, via regularization-by-denoising. The resulting methods
  inherit the advantages of each approach and outperform other noise-robust phase
  retrieval algorithms. Our work paves the way for hybrid imaging methods that integrate
  machine-learned constraints in conventional algorithms.
