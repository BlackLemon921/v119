abstract: Delusional bias is a fundamental source of error in approximate Q-learning.
  To date, the only techniques that explicitly address delusion require comprehensive
  search using tabular value estimates. In this paper, we develop efficient methods
  to mitigate delusional bias by training Q-approximators with labels that are "consistent"
  with the underlying greedy policy class. We introduce a simple penalization scheme
  that encourages Q-labels used across training batches to remain (jointly) consistent
  with the expressible policy class. We also propose a search framework that allows
  multiple Q-approximators to be generated and tracked, thus mitigating the effect
  of premature (implicit) policy commitments. Experimental results demonstrate that
  these methods can improve the performance of Q-learning in a variety of Atari games,
  sometimes dramatically.
