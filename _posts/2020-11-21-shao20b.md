abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their variants have been widely used
  in a variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and disentangled
  representation learning. However, the existing VAE models may suffer from KL vanishing
  in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for disentangling. To address
  these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework,
  ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with
  the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically,
  we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative
  (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE
  objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training. The
  framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling, disentangled
  representation learning, and image generation. The results show that ControlVAE
  can achieve much better reconstruction quality than the competitive methods for
  the comparable disentanglement performance. For language modeling, it not only averts
  the KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text. Finally, we
  also demonstrate that ControlVAE improves the reconstruction quality for image generation
  compared to the original VAE.
