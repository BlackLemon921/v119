abstract: Formation mechanisms are fundamental to the study of complex networks, but
  learning them from observations is challenging. In real-world domains, one often
  has access only to the final constructed graph, instead of the full construction
  process, and observed graphs exhibit complex structural properties. In this work,
  we propose GraphOpt, an end-to-end framework that jointly learns an implicit model
  of graph structure formation and discovers an underlying optimization mechanism
  in the form of a latent objective function. The learned objective can serve as an
  explanation for the observed graph properties, thereby lending itself to transfer
  across different graphs within a domain. GraphOpt poses link formation in graphs
  as a sequential decision-making process and solves it using maximum entropy inverse
  reinforcement learning algorithm. Further, it employs a novel continuous latent
  action space that aids scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that GraphOpt discovers
  a latent objective transferable across graphs with different characteristics. GraphOpt
  also learns a robust stochastic policy that achieves competitive link prediction
  performance without being explicitly trained on this task and further enables construction
  of graphs with properties similar to those of the observed graph.
