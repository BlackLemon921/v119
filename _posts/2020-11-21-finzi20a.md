abstract: The translation equivariance of convolutional layers enables CNNs to generalize
  well on image problems. While translation equivariance provides a powerful inductive
  bias for images, we often additionally desire equivariance to other transformations,
  such as rotations, especially for non-image data. We propose a general method to
  construct a convolutional layer that is equivariant to transformations from any
  specified Lie group with a surjective exponential map. Incorporating equivariance
  to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps,
  enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method,
  we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and
  Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our
  models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular
  momentum.
