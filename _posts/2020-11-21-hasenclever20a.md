abstract: Learning to control complex bodies and reuse learned behaviors is a longstanding
  challenge in continuous control. We study the problem of learning reusable humanoid
  skills by imitating motion capture data and joint training with complementary tasks.
  We show that it is possible to learn reusable skills through reinforcement learning
  on 50 times more motion capture data than prior work. We systematically compare
  a variety of different network architectures across different data regimes both
  in terms of imitation performance as well as transfer to challenging locomotion
  tasks. Finally we show that it is possible to interleave the motion capture tracking
  with training on complementary tasks, enriching the resulting skill space, and enabling
  the reuse of skills not well covered by the motion capture data such as getting
  up from the ground or catching a ball.
