abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is one of the main foundations of modern
  reinforcement learning. This paper studies the use of TD(0), a canonical TD algorithm,
  to estimate the value function of a given policy from a batch of data. In this batch
  setting, we show that TD(0) may converge to an inaccurate value function because
  the update following an action is weighted according to the number of times that
  action occurred in the batch â€“ not the true probability of the action under the
  given policy. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{policy sampling error
  corrected}-TD(0) (PSEC-TD(0)). PSEC-TD(0) first estimates the empirical distribution
  of actions in each state in the batch and then uses importance sampling to correct
  for the mismatch between the empirical weighting and the correct weighting for updates
  following each action. We refine the concept of a certainty-equivalence estimate
  and argue that PSEC-TD(0) is a more data efficient estimator than TD(0) for a fixed
  batch of data. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of PSEC-TD(0) on three
  batch value function learning tasks, with a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
  and show that PSEC-TD(0) produces value function estimates with lower mean squared
  error than TD(0).
