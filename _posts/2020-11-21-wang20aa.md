abstract: Recent papers have demonstrated that ensemble stumps and trees could be
  vulnerable to small input perturbations, so robustness verification and defense
  for those models have become an important research problem. However, due to the
  structure of decision trees, where each node makes decision purely based on one
  feature value, all the previous works only consider the $\ell_\infty$ norm perturbation.
  To study robustness with respect to a general $\ell_p$ norm perturbation, one has
  to consider the correlation between perturbations on different features, which has
  not been handled by previous algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of
  robustness verification and certified defense with respect to general $\ell_p$ norm
  perturbations for ensemble decision stumps and trees. For robustness verification
  of ensemble stumps, we prove that complete verification is NP-complete for $p\in(0,
  \infty)$ while polynomial time algorithms exist for $p=0$ or $\infty$. For $p\in(0,
  \infty)$ we develop an efficient dynamic programming based algorithm for sound verification
  of ensemble stumps. For ensemble trees, we generalize the previous multi-level robustness
  verification algorithm to $\ell_p$ norm. We demonstrate the first certified defense
  method for training ensemble stumps and trees with respect to $\ell_p$ norm perturbations,
  and verify its effectiveness empirically on real datasets.
