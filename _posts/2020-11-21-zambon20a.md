abstract: We present Graph Random Neural Features (GRNF), a novel embedding method
  from graph-structured data to real vectors based on a family of graph neural networks.
  The embedding naturally deals with graph isomorphism and preserves the metric structure
  of the graph domain, in probability. In addition to being an explicit embedding
  method, it also allows us to efficiently and effectively approximate graph metric
  distances (as well as complete kernel functions); a criterion to select the embedding
  dimension trading off the approximation accuracy with the computational cost is
  also provided. GRNF can be used within traditional processing methods or as a training-free
  input layer of a graph neural network. The theoretical guarantees that accompany
  GRNF ensure that the considered graph distance is metric, hence allowing to distinguish
  any pair of non-isomorphic graphs.
