abstract: We study the problem of constructing black-box adversarial attacks, where
  no model information is revealed except for the feedback knowledge of the given
  inputs. To obtain sufficient knowledge for crafting adversarial examples, previous
  methods query the target model with inputs that are perturbed with different searching
  directions. However, these methods suffer from poor query efficiency since the employed
  searching directions are sampled randomly. To mitigate this issue, we formulate
  the goal of mounting efficient attacks as an optimization problem in which the adversary
  tries to fool the target model with a limited number of queries. Under such settings,
  the adversary has to select appropriate searching directions to reduce the number
  of model queries. By solving the efficient-attack problem, we find that we need
  to distill the knowledge in both the path of the adversarial examples and the path
  of the searching directions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, dual-path
  distillation, that utilizes the feedback knowledge not only to craft adversarial
  examples but also to alter the searching directions to achieve efficient attacks.
  Experimental results suggest that our framework can significantly increase the query
  efficiency.
