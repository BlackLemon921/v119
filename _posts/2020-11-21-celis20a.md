abstract: Data containing human or social attributes may over- or under-represent
  groups with respect to salient social attributes such as gender or race, which can
  lead to biases in downstream applications. This paper presents an algorithmic framework
  that can be used as a data preprocessing method towards mitigating such bias. Unlike
  prior work, it can efficiently learn distributions over large domains, controllably
  adjust the representation rates of protected groups and achieve target fairness
  metrics such as statistical parity, yet remains close to the empirical distribution
  induced by the given dataset. Our approach leverages the principle of maximum entropy
  {â€“} amongst all distributions satisfying a given set of constraints, we should choose
  the one closest in KL-divergence to a given prior. While maximum entropy distributions
  can succinctly encode distributions over large domains, they can be difficult to
  compute. Our main contribution is an instantiation of this framework for our set
  of constraints and priors, which encode our bias mitigation goals, and that runs
  in time polynomial in the dimension of the data. Empirically, we observe that samples
  from the learned distribution have desired representation rates and statistical
  rates, and when used for training a classifier incurs only a slight loss in accuracy
  while maintaining fairness properties.
