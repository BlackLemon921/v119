abstract: 'The task of text classification is usually divided into two stages: text
  feature extraction and classification. In this standard formalization, categories
  are merely represented as indexes in the label vocabulary, and the model lacks for
  explicit instructions on what to classify. Inspired by the current trend of formalizing
  NLP problems as question answering tasks, we propose a new framework for text classification,
  in which each category label is associated with a category description. Descriptions
  are generated by hand-crafted templates or using abstractive/extractive models from
  reinforcement learning. The concatenation of the description and the text is fed
  to the classifier to decide whether or not the current label should be assigned
  to the text. The proposed strategy forces the model to attend to the most salient
  texts with respect to the label, which can be regarded as a hard version of attention,
  leading to better performances. We observe significant performance boosts over strong
  baselines on a wide range of text classification tasks including single-label classification,
  multi-label classification and multi-aspect sentiment analysis.'
