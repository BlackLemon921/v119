abstract: Hypothesis testing of random networks is an emerging area of modern research,
  especially in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of samples is smaller
  or comparable to the size of the graph. In this paper we consider the goodness-of-fit
  testing problem for large inhomogeneous random (IER) graphs, where given a (known)
  reference symmetric matrix $Q \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$ and $m$ independent samples
  from an IER graph given by an unknown symmetric matrix $P \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$,
  the goal is to test the hypothesis $P=Q$ versus $||P-Q|| \geq \varepsilon$, where
  $||\cdot||$ is some specified norm on symmetric matrices. Building on recent related
  work on two-sample testing for IER graphs, we derive the optimal minimax sample
  complexities for the goodness-of-fit problem in various natural norms, such as the
  Frobenius norm and the operator norm. We also propose practical implementations
  of natural test statistics, using their asymptotic distributions and through the
  parametric bootstrap. We compare the performances of the different tests in simulations,
  and show that the proposed tests outperform the baseline tests across various natural
  random graphs models.
