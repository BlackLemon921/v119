abstract: We propose Zeno++, a new robust asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)
  procedure, intended to tolerate Byzantine failures of workers. In contrast to previous
  work, Zeno++ removes several unrealistic restrictions on worker-server communication,
  now allowing for fully asynchronous updates from anonymous workers, for arbitrarily
  stale worker updates, and for the possibility of an unbounded number of Byzantine
  workers. The key idea is to estimate the descent of the loss value after the candidate
  gradient is applied, where large descent values indicate that the update results
  in optimization progress. We prove the convergence of Zeno++ for non-convex problems
  under Byzantine failures. Experimental results show that Zeno++ outperforms existing
  Byzantine-tolerant asynchronous SGD algorithms.
