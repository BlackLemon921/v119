abstract: The latent spaces of GAN models often have semantically meaningful directions.
  Moving in these directions corresponds to human-interpretable image transformations,
  such as zooming or recoloring, enabling a more controllable generation process.
  However, the discovery of such directions is currently performed in a supervised
  manner, requiring human labels, pretrained models, or some form of self-supervision.
  These requirements severely restrict a range of directions existing approaches can
  discover. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised method to identify interpretable
  directions in the latent space of a pretrained GAN model. By a simple model-agnostic
  procedure, we find directions corresponding to sensible semantic manipulations without
  any form of (self-)supervision. Furthermore, we reveal several non-trivial findings,
  which would be difficult to obtain by existing methods, e.g., a direction corresponding
  to background removal. As an immediate practical benefit of our work, we show how
  to exploit this finding to achieve competitive performance for weakly-supervised
  saliency detection. The implementation of our method is available online.
