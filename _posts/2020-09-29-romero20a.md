abstract: Although group convolutional networks are able to learn powerful representations
  based on symmetry patterns, they lack explicit means to learn meaningful relationships
  among them (e.g., relative positions and poses). In this paper, we present attentive
  group equivariant convolutions, a generalization of the group convolution, in which
  attention is applied during the course of convolution to accentuate meaningful symmetry
  combinations and suppress non-plausible, misleading ones. We indicate that prior
  work on visual attention can be described as special cases of our proposed framework
  and show empirically that our attentive group equivariant convolutional networks
  consistently outperform conventional group convolutional networks on benchmark image
  datasets. Simultaneously, we provide interpretability to the learned concepts through
  the visualization of equivariant attention maps.
