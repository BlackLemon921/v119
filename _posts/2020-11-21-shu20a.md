abstract: High-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics are major challenges
  when applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning
  Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding the
  observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics,
  and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure the learned
  latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing LCE approaches
  decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform next-observation predictionâ€”a
  challenging high-dimensional task that furthermore introduces a large number of
  nuisance parameters (i.e., the decoder) which are discarded during control. In this
  paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically
  that explicit next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding.
  We then use predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics
  are amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks
  show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to superior
  performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.
