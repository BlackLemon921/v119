abstract: 'Disentangled generative models map a latent code vector to a target space,
  while enforcing that a subset of the learned latent codes are interpretable and
  associated with distinct properties of the target distribution. Recent advances
  have been dominated by Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based methods, while training
  disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) remains challenging. In this
  work, we show that the dominant challenges facing disentangled GANs can be mitigated
  through the use of self-supervision. We make two main contributions: first, we design
  a novel approach for training disentangled GANs with self-supervision. We propose
  contrastive regularizer, which is inspired by a natural notion of disentanglement:
  latent traversal. This achieves higher disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art
  VAE- and GAN-based approaches. Second, we propose an unsupervised model selection
  scheme called ModelCentrality, which uses generated synthetic samples to compute
  the medoid (multi-dimensional generalization of median) of a collection of models.
  The current common practice of hyper-parameter tuning requires using ground-truths
  samples, each labelled with known perfect disentangled latent codes. As real datasets
  are not equipped with such labels, we propose an unsupervised model selection scheme
  and show that it finds a model close to the best one, for both VAEs and GANs. Combining
  contrastive regularization with ModelCentrality, we improve upon the state-of-the-art
  disentanglement scores significantly, without accessing the supervised data.'
