abstract: Recently there has been increased interest in using machine learning techniques
  to improve classical algorithms. In this paper we study when it is possible to construct
  compact, composable sketches for weighted sampling and statistics estimation according
  to functions of data frequencies. Such structures are now central components of
  large-scale data analytics and machine learning pipelines. However, many common
  functions, such as thresholds and $p$th frequency moments with $p>2$, are known
  to require polynomial size sketches in the worst case. We explore performance beyond
  the worst case under two different types of assumptions. The first is having access
  to noisy \emph{advice} on item frequencies. This continues the line of work of Hsu
  et al. (ICLR 2019), who assume predictions are provided by a machine learning model.
  The second is providing guaranteed performance on a restricted class of input frequency
  distributions that are better aligned with what is observed in practice. This extends
  the work on heavy hitters under Zipfian distributions in a seminal paper of Charikar
  et al. (ICALP 2002). Surprisingly, we show analytically and empirically that "in
  practice" small polylogarithmic-size sketches provide accuracy for "hard" functions.
