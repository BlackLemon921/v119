abstract: 'This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning
  of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised
  learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank.
  In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful
  representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework.
  We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining
  effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation
  between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality
  of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger
  batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining
  these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised
  and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised
  representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative
  improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised
  ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1% of the labels, we achieve 85.8% top-5 accuracy,
  outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.'
