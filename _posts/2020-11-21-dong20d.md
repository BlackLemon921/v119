abstract: We compare the model-free reinforcement learning with the model-based approaches
  through the lens of the expressive power of neural networks for policies, Q-functions,
  and dynamics. We show, theoretically and empirically, that even for one-dimensional
  continuous state space, there are many MDPs whose optimal Q-functions and policies
  are much more complex than the dynamics. For these MDPs, model-based planning is
  a favorable algorithm, because the resulting policies can approximate the optimal
  policy significantly better than a neural network parameterization can, and model-free
  or model-based policy optimization rely on policy parameterization. Motivated by
  the theory, we apply a simple multi-step model-based bootstrapping planner (BOOTS)
  to bootstrap a weak Q-function into a stronger policy. Empirical results show that
  applying BOOTS on top of model-based or model-free policy optimization algorithms
  at the test time improves the performance on benchmark tasks.
