abstract: In this work, we investigate the application of Taylor expansions in reinforcement
  learning. In particular, we propose Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization, a policy
  optimization formalism that generalizes prior work as a first-order special case.
  We also show that Taylor expansions intimately relate to off-policy evaluation.
  Finally, we show that this new formulation entails modifications which improve the
  performance of several state-of-the-art distributed algorithms.
