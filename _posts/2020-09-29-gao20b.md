abstract: Frank-Wolfe algorithm is an efficient method for optimizing non-convex constrained
  problems. However, most of existing methods focus on the first-order case. In real-world
  applications, the gradient is not always available. To address the problem of lacking
  gradient in many applications, we propose two new stochastic zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe
  algorithms and theoretically proved that they have a faster convergence rate than
  existing methods for non-convex problems. Specifically, the function queries oracle
  of the proposed faster zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe (FZFW) method is $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon^2})$
  which can match the iteration complexity of the first-order counterpart approximately.
  As for the proposed faster zeroth-order conditional gradient sliding (FZCGS) method,
  its function queries oracle is improved to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}d}{\epsilon})$, indicating
  that its iteration complexity is even better than that of its first-order counterpart
  NCGS-VR. In other words, the iteration complelxity of the accelerated first-order
  Frank-Wolfe method NCGS-VR is suboptimal. Then, we proposed a new algorithm to improve
  its IFO (incremental first-order oracle) to $O(\frac{n^{1/2}}{\epsilon})$. At last,
  the empirical studies on benchmark datasets validate our theoretical results.
