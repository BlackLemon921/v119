abstract: Composition is one of the most important properties of differential privacy
  (DP), as it allows algorithm designers to build complex private algorithms from
  DP primitives. We consider precise composition bounds of the overall privacy loss
  for exponential mechanisms, one of the fundamental classes of mechanisms in DP.
  Exponential mechanism has also become a fundamental building block in private machine
  learning, e.g. private PCA and hyper-parameter selection. We give explicit formulations
  of the optimal privacy loss for both the adaptive and non-adaptive composition of
  exponential mechanism. For the non-adaptive setting in which each mechanism has
  the same privacy parameter, we give an efficiently computable formulation of the
  optimal privacy loss. In the adaptive case, we derive a recursive formula and an
  efficiently computable upper bound. These precise understandings about the problem
  lead to a 40% saving of the privacy budget in a practical application. Furthermore,
  the algorithm-specific analysis shows a difference in privacy parameters of adaptive
  and non-adaptive composition, which was widely believed to not exist based on the
  evidence from general analysis.
