abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world safety-critical target settings
  like urban driving is hazardous, imperiling the RL agent, other agents, and the
  environment. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a "safety-critical adaptation"
  task setting: an agent first trains in non-safety-critical "source" environments
  such as in a simulator, before it adapts to the target environment where failures
  carry heavy costs. We propose a solution approach, CARL, that builds on the intuition
  that prior experience in diverse environments equips an agent to estimate risk,
  which in turn enables relative safety through risk-averse, cautious adaptation.
  CARL first employs model-based RL to train a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty
  about transition dynamics and catastrophic states across varied source environments.
  Then, when exploring a new safety-critical environment with unknown dynamics, the
  CARL agent plans to avoid actions that could lead to catastrophic states. In experiments
  on car driving, cartpole balancing, and half-cheetah locomotion, CARL successfully
  acquires cautious exploration behaviors, yielding higher rewards with fewer failures
  than strong RL adaptation baselines.'
