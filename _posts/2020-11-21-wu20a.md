abstract: Regularization for optimization is a crucial technique to avoid overfitting
  in machine learning. In order to obtain the best performance, we usually train a
  model by tuning the regularization parameters. It becomes costly, however, when
  a single round of training takes significant amount of time. Very recently, Neu
  and Rosasco show that if we run stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on linear regression
  problems, then by averaging the SGD iterates properly, we obtain a regularized solution.
  It left open whether the same phenomenon can be achieved for other optimization
  problems and algorithms. In this paper, we establish an averaging scheme that provably
  converts the iterates of SGD on an arbitrary strongly convex and smooth objective
  function to its regularized counterpart with an adjustable regularization parameter.
  Our approaches can be used for accelerated and preconditioned optimization methods
  as well. We further show that the same methods work empirically on more general
  optimization objectives including neural networks. In sum, we obtain adjustable
  regularization for free for a large class of optimization problems and resolve an
  open question raised by Neu and Rosasco.
