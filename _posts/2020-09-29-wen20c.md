abstract: The problem of adversarial examples has shown that modern Neural Network
  (NN) models could be rather fragile. Among the more established techniques to solve
  the problem, one is to require the model to be \emph{$\epsilon$-adversarially robust}
  (AR); that is, to require the model not to change predicted labels when any given
  input examples are perturbed within a certain range. However, it is observed that
  such methods would lead to standard performance degradation, i.e., the degradation
  on natural examples. In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization
  perspective. We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the
  identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing
  NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space
  (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in
  all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction
  w.r.t. perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples
  around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to
  worse standard performance. Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that
  build AR into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.
