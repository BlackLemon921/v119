abstract: 'We introduce T-Basis, a novel concept for a compact representation of a
  set of tensors, each of an arbitrary shape, which is often seen in Neural Networks.
  Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the concept
  applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of nodes in diagram
  notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally shaped three-dimensional
  tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such representation allows us to parameterize
  the tensor set with a small number of parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors),
  scaling logarithmically with each tensorâ€™s size in the set and linearly with the
  dimensionality of T-Basis. We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural
  network compression and demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable
  performance drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the
  compressed networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for
  training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the edge
  devices. Project website: obukhov.ai/tbasis.'
