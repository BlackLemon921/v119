abstract: In distributed online optimization over a computing network with heterogeneous
  nodes, slow nodes can adversely affect the progress of fast nodes, leading to drastic
  slowdown of the overall convergence process. To address this issue, we consider
  a new algorithm termed Distributed Any-Batch Mirror Descent (DABMD), which is based
  on distributed Mirror Descent but uses a fixed per-round computing time to limit
  the waiting by fast nodes to receive information updates from slow nodes. DABMD
  is characterized by varying minibatch sizes across nodes. It is applicable to a
  broader range of problems compared with existing distributed online optimization
  methods such as those based on dual averaging, and it accommodates time-varying
  network topology. We study two versions of DABMD, depending on whether the computing
  nodes average their primal variables via single or multiple consensus iterations.
  We show that both versions provide strong theoretical performance guarantee, by
  deriving upperbounds on their expected dynamic regret, which capture the variability
  in minibatch sizes. Our experimental results show substantial reduction in cost
  and acceleration in convergence compared with the known best alternative.
