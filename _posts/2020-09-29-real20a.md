abstract: 'Machine learning research has advanced in multiple aspects, including model
  structures and learning methods. The effort to automate such research, known as
  AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely focused
  on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on sophisticated expert-designed
  layers as building blocksâ€”or similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to
  show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover
  complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as
  building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly
  reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this
  space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained
  by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving
  directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge
  in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and
  weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types:
  e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available. We believe these
  preliminary successes in discovering machine learning algorithms from scratch indicate
  a promising new direction for the field.'
