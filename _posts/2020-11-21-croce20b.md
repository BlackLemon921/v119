abstract: The field of defense strategies against adversarial attacks has significantly
  grown over the last years, but progress is hampered as the evaluation of adversarial
  defenses is often insufficient and thus gives a wrong impression of robustness.
  Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it difficult to identify
  the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of
  hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we
  first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal
  step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks
  with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable
  and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply
  our ensemble to over 50 models from papers published at recent top machine learning
  and computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust
  test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than $10%$, identifying
  several broken defenses.
