abstract: This work proposes a progressive manifold identification approach for distributed
  optimization with sound theoretical justifications to greatly reduce both the rounds
  of communication and the bytes communicated per round for partly-smooth regularized
  problems such as the $\ell_1$- and group-LASSO-regularized ones. Our two-stage method
  first uses an inexact proximal quasi-Newton method to iteratively identify a sequence
  of low-dimensional manifolds in which the final solution would lie, and restricts
  the model update within the current manifold to gradually lower the order of the
  per-round communication cost from the problem dimension to the dimension of the
  manifold that contains a solution and makes the problem within it smooth. After
  identifying this manifold, we take superlinear-convergent truncated semismooth Newton
  steps computed by preconditioned conjugate gradient to largely reduce the communication
  rounds by improving the convergence rate from the existing linear or sublinear ones
  to a superlinear rate. Experiments show that our method can be orders of magnitudes
  lower in the communication cost and an order of magnitude faster in the running
  time than the state of the art.
