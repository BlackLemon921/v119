abstract: Many real-world problems require trading off multiple competing objectives.
  However, these objectives are often in different units and/or scales, which can
  make it challenging for practitioners to express numerical preferences over objectives
  in their native units. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for multi-objective
  reinforcement learning that enables setting desired preferences for objectives in
  a scale-invariant way. We propose to learn an action distribution for each objective,
  and we use supervised learning to fit a parametric policy to a combination of these
  distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging high-dimensional
  real and simulated robotics tasks, and show that setting different preferences in
  our framework allows us to trace out the space of nondominated solutions.
