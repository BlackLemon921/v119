abstract: In this paper we describe a new parallel algorithm called Fast Adaptive
  Sequencing Technique (FAST) for maximizing a monotone submodular function under
  a cardinality constraint k. This algorithm achieves the optimal 1-1/e approximation
  guarantee and is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art on a variety
  of experiments over real-world data sets. Following recent work by Balkanski and
  Singer (2018), there has been a great deal of research on algorithms whose theoretical
  parallel runtime is exponentially faster than algorithms used for submodular maximization
  over the past 40 years. However, while these new algorithms are fast in terms of
  asymptotic worst-case guarantees, it is computationally infeasible to use them in
  practice even on small data sets because the number of rounds and queries they require
  depend on large constants and high-degree polynomials in terms of precision and
  confidence. The design principles behind the FAST algorithm we present here are
  a significant departure from those of recent theoretically fast algorithms. Rather
  than optimize for asymptotic theoretical guarantees, the design of FAST introduces
  several new techniques that achieve remarkable practical and theoretical parallel
  runtimes. The approximation guarantee obtained by FAST is arbitrarily close to 1
  - 1/e, and its asymptotic parallel runtime (adaptivity) is O(log(n) log^2(log k))
  using O(n log log(k)) total queries. We show that FAST is orders of magnitude faster
  than any algorithm for submodular maximization we are aware of, including hyper-optimized
  parallel versions of state-of-the-art serial algorithms, by running experiments
  on large data sets.
