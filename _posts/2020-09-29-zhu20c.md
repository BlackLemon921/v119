abstract: In this article, we propose novel structural nested models to estimate causal
  effects of continuous treatments based on mobile health data. To find the treatment
  regime which optimizes the short-term outcomes for the patients, we define the weighted
  lag K advantage. The optimal treatment regime is then defined to be the one which
  maximizes this advantage. This method imposes minimal assumptions on the data generating
  process. Statistical inference can also be provided for the estimated parameters.
  Simulation studies and an application to the Ohio type 1 diabetes dataset show that
  our method could provide meaningful insights for dose suggestions with mobile health
  data.
