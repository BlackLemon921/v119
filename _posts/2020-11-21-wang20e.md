abstract: Sparse principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely-used dimensionality
  reduction tool in statistics and machine learning. Most methods mentioned in literature
  are either heuristics for good primal feasible solutions under statistical assumptions
  or ADMM-type algorithms with stationary/critical points convergence property for
  the regularized reformulation of sparse PCA. However, none of these methods can
  efficiently verify the quality of the solutions via comparing current objective
  values with their dual bounds, especially in model-free case. We propose a new framework
  that finds out upper (dual) bounds for the sparse PCA within polynomial time via
  solving a convex integer program (IP). We show that, in the worst-case, the dual
  bounds provided by the convex IP is within an affine function of the global optimal
  value. Moreover, in contrast to the semi-definition relaxation, this framework is
  much easier to scale on large cases. Numerical results on both artificial and real
  cases are reported to demonstrate the advantages of our method.
