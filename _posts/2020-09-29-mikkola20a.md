abstract: Bayesian optimization is an effective method for finding extrema of a black-box
  function. We propose a new type of Bayesian optimization for learning user preferences
  in high-dimensional spaces. The central assumption is that the underlying objective
  function cannot be evaluated directly, but instead a minimizer along a projection
  can be queried, which we call a projective preferential query. The form of the query
  allows for feedback that is natural for a human to give, and which enables interaction.
  This is demonstrated in a user experiment in which the user feedback comes in the
  form of optimal position and orientation of a molecule adsorbing to a surface. We
  demonstrate that our framework is able to find a global minimum of a high-dimensional
  black-box function, which is an infeasible task for existing preferential Bayesian
  optimization frameworks that are based on pairwise comparisons.
