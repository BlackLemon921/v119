abstract: 'The goal of universal machine translation is to learn to translate between
  any pair of languages. Despite impressive empirical results and an increasing interest
  in massively multilingual models, theoretical analysis on translation errors made
  by such universal machine translation models is only nascent. In this paper, we
  formally prove certain impossibilities of this endeavour in general, as well as
  prove positive results in the presence of additional (but natural) structure of
  data. For the former, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the many-to-many
  translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to learn shared sentence
  representations among multiple language pairs has to make a large translation error
  on at least one of the translation tasks, if no assumption on the structure of the
  languages is made. For the latter, we show that if the paired documents in the corpus
  follow a natural \emph{encoder-decoder} generative process, we can expect a natural
  notion of “generalization”: a linear number of language pairs, rather than quadratic,
  suffices to learn a good representation. Our theory also explains what kinds of
  connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with longer
  paths result in worse sample complexity. We believe our theoretical insights and
  implications contribute to the future algorithmic design of universal machine translation.'
