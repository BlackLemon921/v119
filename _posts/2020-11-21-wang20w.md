abstract: In many real tasks, we care about how to make decisions rather than mere
  predictions on an event, e.g. how to increase the revenue next month instead of
  merely knowing it will drop. The key is to identify the causal effects on the desired
  event. It is achievable with do-calculus if the causal structure is known; however,
  in many real tasks it is not easy to infer the whole causal structure with the observational
  data. Introducing external interventions is needed to achieve it. In this paper,
  we study the situation where only the response variable is observable under intervention.
  We propose a novel approach which is able to cost-effectively identify the causal
  effects, by an active strategy introducing limited interventions, and thus guide
  decision-making. Theoretical analysis and empirical studies validate the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach.
