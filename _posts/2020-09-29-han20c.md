abstract: 'Given data with noisy labels, over-parameterized deep networks can gradually
  memorize the data, and fit everything in the end. Although equipped with corrections
  for noisy labels, many learning methods in this area still suffer overfitting due
  to undesired memorization. In this paper, to relieve this issue, we propose stochastic
  integrated gradient underweighted ascent (SIGUA): in a mini-batch, we adopt gradient
  descent on good data as usual, and learning-rate-reduced gradient ascent on bad
  data; the proposal is a versatile approach where data goodness or badness is w.r.t.
  desired or undesired memorization given a base learning method. Technically, SIGUA
  pulls optimization back for generalization when their goals conflict with each other;
  philosophically, SIGUA shows forgetting undesired memorization can reinforce desired
  memorization. Experiments demonstrate that SIGUA successfully robustifies two typical
  base learning methods, so that their performance is often significantly improved.'
