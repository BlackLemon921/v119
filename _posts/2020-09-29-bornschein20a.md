abstract: Highly overparametrized neural networks can display curiously strong generalization
  performance â€“ a phenomenon that has recently garnered a wealth of theoretical and
  empirical research in order to better understand it. In contrast to most previous
  work, which typically considers the performance as a function of the model size,
  in this paper we empirically study the generalization performance as the size of
  the training set varies over multiple orders of magnitude. These systematic experiments
  lead to some interesting and potentially very useful observations; perhaps most
  notably that training on smaller subsets of the data can lead to more reliable model
  selection decisions whilst simultaneously enjoying smaller computational overheads.
  Our experiments furthermore allow us to estimate Minimum Description Lengths for
  common datasets given modern neural network architectures, thereby paving the way
  for principled model selection taking into account Occams-razor.
