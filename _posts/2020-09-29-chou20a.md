abstract: In weakly supervised learning, unbiased risk estimator(URE) is a powerful
  tool for training classifiers when training and test data are drawn from different
  distributions. Nevertheless, UREs lead to overfitting in many problem settings when
  the models are complex like deep networks. In this paper, we investigate reasons
  for such overfitting by studying a weakly supervised problem called learning with
  complementary labels. We argue the quality of gradient estimation matters more in
  risk minimization. Theoretically, we show that a URE gives an unbiased gradient
  estimator(UGE). Practically, however, UGEs may suffer from huge variance, which
  causes empirical gradients to be usually far away from true gradients during minimization.
  To this end, we propose a novel surrogate complementary loss(SCL) framework that
  trades zero bias with reduced variance and makes empirical gradients more aligned
  with true gradients in the direction. Thanks to this characteristic, SCL successfully
  mitigates the overfitting issue and improves URE-based methods.
