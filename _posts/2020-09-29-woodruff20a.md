abstract: To accelerate kernel methods, we propose a near input sparsity time method
  for sampling the high-dimensional space implicitly defined by a kernel transformation.
  Our main contribution is an importance sampling method for subsampling the feature
  space of a degree $q$ tensoring of data points in almost input sparsity time, improving
  the recent oblivious sketching of (Ahle et al., 2020) by a factor of $q^{5/2}/\epsilon^2$.
  This leads to a subspace embedding for the polynomial kernel as well as the Gaussian
  kernel with a target dimension that is only linearly dependent on the statistical
  dimension of the kernel and in time which is only linearly dependent on the sparsity
  of the input dataset. We show how our subspace embedding bounds imply new statistical
  guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Furthermore, we empirically show that in
  large-scale regression tasks, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art kernel
  approximation methods.
