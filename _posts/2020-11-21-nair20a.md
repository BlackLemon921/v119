abstract: Learned dynamics models combined with both planning and policy learning
  algorithms have shown promise in enabling artificial agents to learn to perform
  many diverse tasks with limited supervision. However, one of the fundamental challenges
  in using a learned forward dynamics model is the mismatch between the objective
  of the learned model (future state reconstruction), and that of the downstream planner
  or policy (completing a specified task). This issue is exacerbated by vision-based
  control tasks in diverse real-world environments, where the complexity of the real
  world dwarfs model capacity. In this paper, we propose to direct prediction towards
  task relevant information, enabling the model to be aware of the current task and
  encouraging it to only model relevant quantities of the state space, resulting in
  a learning objective that more closely matches the downstream task. Further, we
  do so in an entirely self-supervised manner, without the need for a reward function
  or image labels. We find that our method more effectively models the relevant parts
  of the scene conditioned on the goal, and as a result outperforms standard task-agnostic
  dynamics models and model-free reinforcement learning.
