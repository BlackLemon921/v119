abstract: For an explanation of a deep learning model to be effective, it must provide
  both insight into a model and suggest a corresponding action in order to achieve
  some objective. Too often, the litany of proposed explainable deep learning methods
  stop at the first step, providing practitioners with insight into a model, but no
  way to act on it. In this paper, we propose contextual decomposition explanation
  penalization (CDEP), a method which enables practitioners to leverage existing explanation
  methods to increase the predictive accuracy of a deep learning model. In particular,
  when shown that a model has incorrectly assigned importance to some features, CDEP
  enables practitioners to correct these errors by inserting domain knowledge into
  the model via explanations. We demonstrate the ability of CDEP to increase performance
  on an array of toy and real datasets.
