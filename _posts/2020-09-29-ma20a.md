abstract: Tasks in multi-task learning often correlate, conflict, or even compete
  with each other. As a result, a single solution that is optimal for all tasks rarely
  exists. Recent papers introduced the concept of Pareto optimality to this field
  and directly cast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization problems,
  but solutions returned by existing methods are typically finite, sparse, and discrete.
  We present a novel, efficient method that generates locally continuous Pareto sets
  and Pareto fronts, which opens up the possibility of continuous analysis of Pareto
  optimal solutions in machine learning problems. We scale up theoretical results
  in multi-objective optimization to modern machine learning problems by proposing
  a sample-based sparse linear system, for which standard Hessian-free solvers in
  machine learning can be applied. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art algorithms
  and demonstrate its usage of analyzing local Pareto sets on various multi-task classification
  and regression problems. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm reveals
  the primary directions in local Pareto sets for trade-off balancing, finds more
  solutions with different trade-offs efficiently, and scales well to tasks with millions
  of parameters.
