abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Lyapunov-like differential inequality that
  allows us to establish finite-time stability of a continuous-time state-space dynamical
  system represented via a multivariate ordinary differential equation or differential
  inclusion. Equipped with this condition, we successfully synthesize first and second-order
  dynamical systems that achieve finite-time convergence to the minima of a given
  sufficiently regular cost function. As a byproduct, we show that the p-rescaled
  gradient flow (p-RGF) proposed by Wibisono et al. (2016) is indeed finite-time convergent,
  provided the cost function is gradient dominated of order q in (1,p). Thus, we effectively
  bridge a gap between the p-RGF and the normalized gradient flow (NGF) (p=\infty)
  proposed by Cortes (2006) in his seminal paper in the context of multi-agent systems.
  We discuss strategies to discretize our proposed flows and conclude by conducting
  some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.
