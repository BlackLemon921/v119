abstract: Machine Teaching studies how efficiently a Teacher can guide a Learner to
  a target hypothesis. We focus on the model of Machine Teaching with a black box
  learner introduced in [Dasgupta et al., ICML 2019], where the teaching is done interactively
  without having any knowledge of the Learner’s algorithm and class of hypotheses,
  apart from the fact that it contains the target hypothesis $h^*$. We first refine
  some existing results for this model and, then, we study new variants of it. Motivated
  by the realistic possibility that $h^*$ is not available to the learner, we consider
  the case where the teacher can only aim at having the learner converge to a best
  available approximation of $h^*$. We also consider weaker black box learners, where,
  in each round, the choice of the consistent hypothesis returned to the Teacher is
  not adversarial, and in particular, we show that better provable bounds can be obtained
  for a type of Learner that moves to the next hypothesis smoothly, preferring hypotheses
  that are close to the current one; and for another type of Learner that can provide
  to the Teacher hypotheses chosen at random among those consistent with the examples
  received so far. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our basic interactive
  teacher on real datasets.
