abstract: We present an approach for unsupervised domain adaptation{—}with a strong
  focus on practical considerations of within-domain class imbalance and between-domain
  class distribution shift{—}from a class-conditioned domain alignment perspective.
  Current methods for class-conditioned domain alignment aim to explicitly minimize
  a loss function based on pseudo-label estimations of the target domain. However,
  these methods suffer from pseudo-label bias in the form of error accumulation. We
  propose a method that removes the need for explicit optimization of model parameters
  from pseudo-labels. Instead, we present a sampling-based implicit alignment approach,
  where the sample selection is implicitly guided by the pseudo-labels. Theoretical
  analysis reveals the existence of a domain-discriminator shortcut in misaligned
  classes, which is addressed by the proposed approach to facilitate domain-adversarial
  learning. Empirical results and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the
  proposed approach, especially in the presence of within-domain class imbalance and
  between-domain class distribution shift.
