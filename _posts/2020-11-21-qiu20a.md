abstract: We study the robust one-bit compressed sensing problem whose goal is to
  design an algorithm that faithfully recovers any sparse target vector $\theta_0\in\mathbb{R}^d$
  \emph{uniformly} via $m$ quantized noisy measurements. Specifically, we consider
  a new framework for this problem where the sparsity is implicitly enforced via mapping
  a low dimensional representation $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^k$ through a known $n$-layer
  ReLU generative network $G:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\theta_0
  = G(x_0)$. Such a framework poses low-dimensional priors on $\theta_0$ without a
  known sparsity basis. We propose to recover the target $G(x_0)$ solving an unconstrained
  empirical risk minimization (ERM). Under a weak \emph{sub-exponential measurement
  assumption}, we establish a joint statistical and computational analysis. In particular,
  we prove that the ERM estimator in this new framework achieves a statistical rate
  of $m=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(kn \log d /\varepsilon^2)$ recovering any $G(x_0)$
  uniformly up to an error $\varepsilon$. When the network is shallow (i.e., $n$ is
  small), we show this rate matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithm
  factors of $\varepsilon^{-1}$. From the lens of computation, we prove that under
  proper conditions on the network weights, our proposed empirical risk, despite non-convexity,
  has no stationary point outside of small neighborhoods around the true representation
  $x_0$ and its negative multiple; furthermore, we show that the global minimizer
  of the empirical risk stays within the neighborhood around $x_0$ rather than its
  negative multiple under further assumptions on weights.
