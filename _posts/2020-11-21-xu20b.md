abstract: We consider imbalanced classification, the problem in which a label may
  have low marginal probability relative to other labels, by weighting losses according
  to the correct class. First, we examine the convergence rates of the expected excess
  weighted risk of plug-in classifiers where the weighting for the plug-in classifier
  and the risk may be different. This leads to irreducible errors that do not converge
  to the weighted Bayes risk, which motivates our consideration of robust risks. We
  define a robust risk that minimizes risk over a set of weightings, show excess risk
  bounds for this problem, and demonstrate that particular choices of the weighting
  set leads to a special instance of conditional value at risk (CVaR) from stochastic
  programming, which we call label conditional value at risk (LCVaR). Additionally,
  we generalize this weighting to derive a new robust risk problem that we call label
  heterogeneous conditional value at risk (LHCVaR). Finally, we empirically demonstrate
  the efficacy of LCVaR and LHCVaR on improving class conditional risks.
