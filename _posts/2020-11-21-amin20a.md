abstract: Knowledge graphs are incomplete by nature, with only a limited number of
  observed facts from the world knowledge being represented as structured relations
  between entities. To partly address this issue, an important task in statistical
  relational learning is that of link prediction or knowledge graph completion. Both
  linear and non-linear models have been proposed to solve the problem. Bilinear models,
  while expressive, are prone to overfitting and lead to quadratic growth of parameters
  in number of relations. Simpler models have become more standard, with certain constraints
  on bilinear map as relation parameters. In this work, we propose a factorized bilinear
  pooling model, commonly used in multi-modal learning, for better fusion of entities
  and relations, leading to an efficient and constraint-free model. We prove that
  our model is fully expressive, providing bounds on the embedding dimensionality
  and factorization rank. Our model naturally generalizes Tucker decomposition based
  TuckER model, which has been shown to generalize other models, as efficient low-rank
  approximation without substantially compromising the performance. Due to low-rank
  approximation, the model complexity can be controlled by the factorization rank,
  avoiding the possible cubic growth of TuckER. Empirically, we evaluate on real-world
  datasets, reaching on par or state-of-the-art performance. At extreme low-ranks,
  model preserves the performance while staying parameter efficient.
