abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a natural and well-studied model for structured
  exploration/exploitation problems and are widely used in applications such as on-line
  marketing and recommendation. One of the main challenges faced by practitioners
  hoping to apply existing algorithms is that usually the feedback is randomly delayed
  and delays are only partially observable. For example, while a purchase is usually
  observable some time after the display, the decision of not buying is never explicitly
  sent to the system. In other words, the learner only observes delayed positive events.
  We formalize this problem as a novel stochastic delayed linear bandit and propose
  OTFLinUCB and OTFLinTS, two computationally efficient algorithms able to integrate
  new information as it becomes available and to deal with the permanently censored
  feedback. We prove optimal O(d\sqrt{T}) bounds on the regret of the first algorithm
  and study the dependency on delay-dependent parameters. Our model, assumptions and
  results are validated by experiments on simulated and real data.
