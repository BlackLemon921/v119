abstract: 'We propose a transductive Laplacian-regularized inference for few-shot
  tasks. Given any feature embedding learned from the base classes, we minimize a
  quadratic binary-assignment function containing two terms: (1) a unary term assigning
  query samples to the nearest class prototype, and (2) a pairwise Laplacian term
  encouraging nearby query samples to have consistent label assignments. Our transductive
  inference does not re-train the base model, and can be viewed as a graph clustering
  of the query set, subject to supervision constraints from the support set. We derive
  a computationally efficient bound optimizer of a relaxation of our function, which
  computes independent (parallel) updates for each query sample, while guaranteeing
  convergence. Following a simple cross-entropy training on the base classes, and
  without complex meta-learning strategies, we conducted comprehensive experiments
  over five few-shot learning benchmarks. Our LaplacianShot consistently outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods by significant margins across different models, settings,
  and data sets. Furthermore, our transductive inference is very fast, with computational
  times that are close to inductive inference, and can be used for large-scale few-shot
  tasks.'
