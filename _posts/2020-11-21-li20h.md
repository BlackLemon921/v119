abstract: The goal of text generation models is to fit the underlying real probability
  distribution of text. For performance evaluation, quality and diversity metrics
  are usually applied. However, it is still not clear to what extend can the quality-diversity
  evaluation reflect the distribution-fitting goal. In this paper, we try to reveal
  such relation in a theoretical approach. We prove that under certain conditions,
  a linear combination of quality and diversity constitutes a divergence metric between
  the generated distribution and the real distribution. We also show that the commonly
  used BLEU/Self-BLEU metric pair fails to match any divergence metric, thus propose
  CR/NRR as a substitute for quality/diversity metric pair.
