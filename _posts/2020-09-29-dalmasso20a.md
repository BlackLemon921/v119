abstract: Parameter estimation, statistical tests and conﬁdence sets are the cornerstones
  of classical statistics that allow scientists to make inferences about the underlying
  process that generated the observed data. A key question is whether one can still
  construct hypothesis tests and conﬁdence sets with proper coverage and high power
  in a so-called likelihood-free inference (LFI) setting; that is, a setting where
  the likelihood is not explicitly known but one can forward-simulate observable data
  according to a stochastic model. In this paper, we present ACORE (Approximate Computation
  via Odds Ratio Estimation), a frequentist approach to LFI that ﬁrst formulates the
  classical likelihood ratio test (LRT) as a parametrized classiﬁcation problem, and
  then uses the equivalence of tests and conﬁdence sets to build conﬁdence regions
  for parameters of interest. We also present a goodness-of-ﬁt procedure for checking
  whether the constructed tests and conﬁdence regions are valid. ACORE is based on
  the key observation that the LRT statistic, the rejection probability of the test,
  and the coverage of the conﬁdence set are conditional distribution functions which
  often vary smoothly as a function of the parameters of interest. Hence, instead
  of relying solely on samples simulated at ﬁxed parameter settings (as is the convention
  in standard Monte Carlo solutions), one can leverage machine learning tools and
  data simulated in the neighborhood of a parameter to improve estimates of quantities
  of interest. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of ACORE with both theoretical and empirical
  results. Our implementation is available on Github.
