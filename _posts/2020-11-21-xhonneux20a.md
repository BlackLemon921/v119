abstract: This paper builds on the connection between graph neural networks and traditional
  dynamical systems. We propose continuous graph neural networks (CGNN), which generalise
  existing graph neural networks with discrete dynamics in that they can be viewed
  as a specific discretisation scheme. The key idea is how to characterise the continuous
  dynamics of node representations, i.e. the derivatives of node representations,
  w.r.t. time.Inspired by existing diffusion-based methods on graphs (e.g. PageRank
  and epidemic models on social networks), we define the derivatives as a combination
  of the current node representations,the representations of neighbors, and the initial
  values of the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphs{—}including
  each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change independently
  or interact with each other{—}both with theoretical justification. The proposed
  continuous graph neural net-works are robust to over-smoothing and hence allow us
  to build deeper networks, which in turn are able to capture the long-range dependencies
  between nodes. Experimental results on the task of node classification demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.
