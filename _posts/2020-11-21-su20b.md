abstract: Beyond machine learningâ€™s success in the specific tasks, research for learning
  multiple tasks simultaneously is referred to as multi-task learning. However, existing
  multi-task learning needs manual definition of tasks and manual task annotation.
  A crucial problem for advanced intelligence is how to understand the human task
  concept using basic input-output pairs. Without task definition, samples from multiple
  tasks are mixed together and result in a confusing mapping challenge. We propose
  Confusing Supervised Learning (CSL) that takes these confusing samples and extracts
  task concepts by differentiating between these samples. We theoretically proved
  the feasibility of the CSL framework and designed an iterative algorithm to distinguish
  between tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our CSL methods could achieve a
  human-like task understanding without task labeling in multi-function regression
  problems and multi-task recognition problems.
