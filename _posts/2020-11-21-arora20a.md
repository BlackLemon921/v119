abstract: A common strategy in modern learning systems is to learn a representation
  that is useful for many tasks, a.k.a. representation learning. We study this strategy
  in the imitation learning setting for Markov decision processes (MDPs) where multiple
  experts’ trajectories are available. We formulate representation learning as a bi-level
  optimization problem where the “outer" optimization tries to learn the joint representation
  and the “inner" optimization encodes the imitation learning setup and tries to learn
  task-specific parameters. We instantiate this framework for the imitation learning
  settings of behavior cloning and observation-alone. Theoretically, we show using
  our framework that representation learning can provide sample complexity benefits
  for imitation learning in both settings. We also provide proof-of-concept experiments
  to verify our theory.
