abstract: This paper introduces the boomerang sampler as a novel class of continuous-time
  non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The methodology begins by representing
  the target density as a density, $e^{-U}$, with respect to a prescribed (usually)
  Gaussian measure and constructs a continuous trajectory consisting of a piecewise
  circular path. The method moves from one circular orbit to another according to
  a rate function which can be written in terms of $U$. We demonstrate that the method
  is easy to implement and demonstrate empirically that it can out-perform existing
  benchmark piecewise deterministic Markov processes such as the bouncy particle sampler
  and the Zig-Zag. In the Bayesian statistics context, these competitor algorithms
  are of substantial interest in the large data context due to the fact that they
  can adopt data subsampling techniques which are exact (ie induce no error in the
  stationary distribution). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that we can
  also construct a control-variate subsampling boomerang sampler which is also exact,
  and which possesses remarkable scaling properties in the large data limit. We furthermore
  illustrate a factorised version on the simulation of diffusion bridges.
