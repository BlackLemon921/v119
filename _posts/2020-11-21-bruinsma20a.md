abstract: Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) leverage the flexibility and interpretability
  of GPs while capturing structure across outputs, which is desirable, for example,
  in spatio-temporal modelling. The key problem with MOGPs is their computational
  scaling $O(n^3 p^3)$, which is cubic in the number of both inputs $n$ (e.g., time
  points or locations) and outputs $p$. For this reason, a popular class of MOGPs
  assumes that the data live around a low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing the
  complexity to $O(n^3 m^3)$. However, this cost is still cubic in the dimensionality
  of the subspace $m$, which is still prohibitively expensive for many applications.
  We propose the use of a sufficient statistic of the data to accelerate inference
  and learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method achieves linear scaling
  in $m$ in practice, allowing these models to scale to large $m$ without sacrificing
  significant expressivity or requiring approximation. This advance opens up a wide
  range of real-world tasks and can be combined with existing GP approximations in
  a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on various synthetic
  and real-world data sets.
