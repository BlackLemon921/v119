abstract: Low rank matrix factorization is a fundamental building block in machine
  learning, used for instance to summarize gene expression profile data or word-document
  counts. To be robust to outliers and differences in scale across features, a matrix
  factorization step is usually preceded by ad-hoc feature normalization steps, such
  as tf-idf scaling or data whitening. We propose in this work to learn these normalization
  operators jointly with the factorization itself. More precisely, given a $d\times
  n$ matrix $X$ of $d$ features measured on $n$ individuals, we propose to learn the
  parameters of quantile normalization operators that can operate row-wise on the
  values of $X$ and/or of its factorization $UV$ to improve the quality of the low-rank
  representation of $X$ itself. This optimization is facilitated by the introduction
  of a new differentiable quantile normalization operator built using optimal transport,
  providing new results on top of existing work by Cuturi et al. (2019). We demonstrate
  the applicability of these techniques on synthetic and genomics datasets.
