abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide flexible distributions over functions,
  with inductive biases controlled by a kernel. However, in many applications Gaussian
  processes can struggle with even moderate input dimensionality. Learning a low dimensional
  projection can help alleviate this curse of dimensionality, but introduces many
  trainable hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome, especially in the small data
  regime. We use additive sums of kernels for GP regression, where each kernel operates
  on a different random projection of its inputs. Surprisingly, we find that as the
  number of random projections increases, the predictive performance of this approach
  quickly converges to the performance of a kernel operating on the original full
  dimensional inputs, over a wide range of data sets, even if we are projecting into
  a single dimension. As a consequence, many problems can remarkably be reduced to
  one dimensional input spaces, without learning a transformation. We prove this convergence
  and its rate, and additionally propose a deterministic approach that converges more
  quickly than purely random projections. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach can
  achieve faster inference and improved predictive accuracy for high-dimensional inputs
  compared to kernels in the original input space.
