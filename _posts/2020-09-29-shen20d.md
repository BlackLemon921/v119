abstract: Phase I dose-finding trials are increasingly challenging as the relationship
  between efficacy and toxicity of new compounds (or combination of them) becomes
  more complex. Despite this, most commonly used methods in practice focus on identifying
  a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by learning only from toxicity events. We present
  a novel adaptive clinical trial methodology, called Safe Efficacy Exploration Dose
  Allocation (SEEDA), that aims at maximizing the cumulative efficacies while satisfying
  the toxicity safety constraint with high probability. We evaluate performance objectives
  that have operational meanings in practical clinical trials, including cumulative
  efficacy, recommendation/allocation success probabilities, toxicity violation probability,
  and sample efficiency. An extended SEEDA-Plateau algorithm that is tailored for
  the increase-then-plateau efficacy behavior of molecularly targeted agents (MTA)
  is also presented. Through numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world
  datasets, we show that SEEDA outperforms state-of-the-art clinical trial designs
  by finding the optimal dose with higher success rate and fewer patients.
