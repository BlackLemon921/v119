abstract: 'In video prediction tasks, one major challenge is to capture the multi-modal
  nature of future contents and dynamics. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
  framework that can efficiently predict plausible future states, where the key insight
  is that the potential distribution of a sequence could be approximated with analogous
  ones in a repertoire of training pool, namely, expert examples. By further incorporating
  a novel optimization scheme into the training procedure, plausible predictions can
  be sampled efficiently from distribution constructed from the retrieved examples.
  Meanwhile, our method could be seamlessly integrated with existing stochastic predictive
  models; significant enhancement is observed with comprehensive experiments in both
  quantitative and qualitative aspects. We also demonstrate the generalization ability
  to predict the motion of unseen class, i.e., without access to corresponding data
  during training phase. Project Page: \hyperlink{https://sites.google.com/view/vpeg-supp/home.}{https://sites.google.com/view/vpeg-supp/home.}'
