abstract: Trustworthy AI is a critical issue in machine learning where, in addition
  to training a model that is accurate, one must consider both fair and robust training
  in the presence of data bias and poisoning. However, the existing model fairness
  techniques mistakenly view poisoned data as an additional bias to be fixed, resulting
  in severe performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose FR-Train,
  which holistically performs fair and robust model training. We provide a mutual
  information-based interpretation of an existing adversarial training-based fairness-only
  method, and apply this idea to architect an additional discriminator that can identify
  poisoned data using a clean validation set and reduce its influence. In our experiments,
  FR-Train shows almost no decrease in fairness and accuracy in the presence of data
  poisoning by both mitigating the bias and defending against poisoning. We also demonstrate
  how to construct clean validation sets using crowdsourcing, and release new benchmark
  datasets.
