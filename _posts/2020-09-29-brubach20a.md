abstract: Clustering is a foundational problem in machine learning with numerous applications.
  As machine learning increases in ubiquity as a backend for automated systems, concerns
  about fairness arise. Much of the current literature on fairness deals with discrimination
  against protected classes in supervised learning (group fairness). We define a different
  notion of fair clustering wherein the probability that two points (or a community
  of points) become separated is bounded by an increasing function of their pairwise
  distance (or community diameter). We capture the situation where data points represent
  people who gain some benefit from being clustered together. Unfairness arises when
  certain points are deterministically separated, either arbitrarily or by someone
  who intends to harm them as in the case of gerrymandering election districts. In
  response, we formally define two new types of fairness in the clustering setting,
  pairwise fairness and community preservation. To explore the practicality of our
  fairness goals, we devise an approach for extending existing $k$-center algorithms
  to satisfy these fairness constraints. Analysis of this approach proves that reasonable
  approximations can be achieved while maintaining fairness. In experiments, we compare
  the effectiveness of our approach to classical $k$-center algorithms/heuristics
  and explore the tradeoff between optimal clustering and fairness.
