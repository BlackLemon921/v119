abstract: Uncertainty quantification is a fundamental yet unsolved problem for deep
  learning. The Bayesian framework provides a principled way of uncertainty estimation
  but is often not scalable to modern deep neural nets (DNNs) that have a large number
  of parameters. Non-Bayesian methods are simple to implement but often conflate different
  sources of uncertainties and require huge computing resources. We propose a new
  method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective.
  The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic
  dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty.
  Based on this perspective, we propose a neural stochastic differential equation
  model (SDE-Net) which consists of (1) a drift net that controls the system to fit
  the predictive function; and (2) a diffusion net that captures epistemic uncertainty.
  We theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to SDE-Net.
  Our experiments demonstrate that the SDE-Net model can outperform existing uncertainty
  estimation methods across a series of tasks where uncertainty plays a fundamental
  role.
