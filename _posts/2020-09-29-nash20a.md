abstract: Polygon meshes are an efficient representation of 3D geometry, and are of
  central importance in computer graphics, robotics and games development. Existing
  learning-based approaches for object synthesis have avoided the challenges of working
  with 3D meshes, instead using alternative object representations that are more compatible
  with neural architectures and training approaches. We present PolyGen, a generative
  model of 3D objects which models the mesh directly, predicting vertices and faces
  sequentially using a Transformer-based architecture. Our model can condition on
  a range of inputs, including object classes, voxels, and images, and because the
  model is probabilistic it can produce samples that capture uncertainty in ambiguous
  scenarios. We show that the model is capable of producing high-quality, usable meshes,
  and establish log-likelihood benchmarks for the mesh-modelling task. We also evaluate
  the conditional models on surface reconstruction metrics against alternative methods,
  and demonstrate competitive performance despite not training directly on this task.
