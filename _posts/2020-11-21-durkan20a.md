abstract: Likelihood-free methods perform parameter inference in stochastic simulator
  models where evaluating the likelihood is intractable but sampling synthetic data
  is possible. One class of methods for this likelihood-free problem uses a classifier
  to distinguish between pairs of parameter-observation samples generated using the
  simulator and pairs sampled from some reference distribution, which implicitly learns
  a density ratio proportional to the likelihood. Another popular class of methods
  fits a conditional distribution to the parameter posterior directly, and a particular
  recent variant allows for the use of flexible neural density estimators for this
  task. In this work, we show that both of these approaches can be unified under a
  general contrastive learning scheme, and clarify how they should be run and compared.
