abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a promising avenue for probabilistic modeling,
  as they permit a wide range of exact and efficient inference routines. Recent “deep-learning-style”
  implementations of PCs strive for a better scalability, but are still difficult
  to train on real-world data, due to their sparsely connected computational graphs.
  In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel implementation design
  for PCs, improving prior art in several regards. At their core, EiNets combine a
  large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading
  to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to
  previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation
  of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic
  differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets
  which were previously out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be
  used as faithful generative image models.
