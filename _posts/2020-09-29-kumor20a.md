abstract: We develop a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of structural
  coefficients in linear causal models that subsumes previous efficient state-of-the-art
  methods, unifying several disparate approaches to identification in this setting.
  Building on these results, we develop a procedure for identifying total causal effects
  in linear systems.
