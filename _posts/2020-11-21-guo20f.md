abstract: In this paper, we study distributed algorithms for large-scale AUC maximization
  with a deep neural network as a predictive model. Although distributed learning
  techniques have been investigated extensively in deep learning, they are not directly
  applicable to stochastic AUC maximization with deep neural networks due to its striking
  differences from standard loss minimization problems (e.g., cross-entropy). Towards
  addressing this challenge, we propose and analyze a communication-efficient distributed
  optimization algorithm based on a \emph{non-convex concave} reformulation of the
  AUC maximization, in which the communication of both the primal variable and the
  dual variable between each worker and the parameter server only occurs after multiple
  steps of gradient-based updates in each worker. Compared with the naive parallel
  version of an existing algorithm that computes stochastic gradients at individual
  machines and averages them for updating the model parameter, our algorithm requires
  a much less number of communication rounds and still achieves linear speedup in
  theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} work that solves
  the \emph{non-convex concave min-max} problem for AUC maximization with deep neural
  networks in a communication-efficient distributed manner while still maintaining
  the linear speedup property in theory. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets
  show the effectiveness of our algorithm and also confirm our theory.
