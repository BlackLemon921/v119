abstract: Randomized smoothing, using just a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution,
  has been shown to produce good robustness guarantees against $\ell_2$-norm bounded
  adversaries. In this work, we show that extending the smoothing technique to defend
  against other attack models can be challenging, especially in the high-dimensional
  regime. In particular, for a vast class of i.i.d.Â smoothing distributions, we prove
  that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2}
  - \frac{1}{p}})$ with dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence
  on $d$ is no better than that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using
  isotropic Gaussian smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the
  robustness radius. When restricted to \emph{generalized} Gaussian smoothing, these
  two bounds can be shown to be within a constant factor of each other in an asymptotic
  sense, establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best possible results,
  up to a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present experimental results on CIFAR
  to validate our theory. For other smoothing distributions, such as, a uniform distribution
  within an $\ell_1$ or an $\ell_\infty$-norm ball, we show upper bounds of the form
  $O(1 / d)$ and $O(1 / d^{1 - \frac{1}{p}})$ respectively, which have an even worse
  dependence on $d$.
