abstract: Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs achieve outstanding performance on
  various tasks, their high computation demand and massive number of parameters make
  it difficult to deploy these SOTA CNNs onto resource-constrained devices. Previous
  works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the original convolution
  layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods are very difficult to
  conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution speedup since redundancies within
  the CNN model are not fully exploited. We argue that kernel granularity decomposition
  can be conducted with low-rank assumption while exploiting the redundancy within
  the remaining compact coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI,
  a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and
  hardware efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution
  layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases and
  coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune 97% parameters
  and 92% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and achieve a 44% reduction
  in run-time memory consumption and a 53% reduction in inference latency.
