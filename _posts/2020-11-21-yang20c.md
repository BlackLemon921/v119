abstract: 'Randomized smoothing is the current state-of-the-art defense with provable
  robustness against $\ell_2$ adversarial attacks. Many works have devised new randomized
  smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however,
  substantial effort was needed to derive such new guarantees. This begs the question:
  can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing? We propose a novel framework
  for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness
  in practice. Our theoretical contributions are: (1) we show that for an appropriate
  notion of "optimal", the optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norms have
  level sets given by the normâ€™s *Wulff Crystal*; (2) we propose two novel and complementary
  methods for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution; and,
  (3) we show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the
  theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve
  the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. Meanwhile,
  we show using (3) that with only label statistics under random input perturbations,
  randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified accuracy against perturbations
  of $\ell_p$-norm $\Omega(\min(1, d^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}))$, when the input
  dimension $d$ is large. We provide code in github.com/tonyduan/rs4a.'
