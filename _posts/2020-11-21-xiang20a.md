abstract: Graphical modeling has been broadly useful for exploring the dependence
  structure among features in a dataset. However, the strength of graphical modeling
  hinges on our ability to encode and estimate conditional dependencies. In particular,
  commonly used measures such as partial correlation are only meaningful under strongly
  parametric (in this case, multivariate Gaussian) assumptions. These assumptions
  are unverifiable, and there is often little reason to believe they hold in practice.
  In this paper, we instead consider 3 non-parametric measures of conditional dependence.
  These measures are meaningful without structural assumptions on the multivariate
  distribution of the data. In addition, we show that for 2 of these measures there
  are simple, strong plug-in estimators that require only the estimation of a conditional
  mean. These plug-in estimators (1) are asymptotically linear and non-parametrically
  efficient, (2) allow incorporation of flexible machine learning techniques for conditional
  mean estimation, and (3) enable the construction of valid Wald-type confidence intervals.
  In addition, by leveraging the influence function of these estimators, one can obtain
  intervals with simultaneous coverage guarantees for all pairs of features.
