abstract: 'Classical approaches for one-class problems such as one-class SVM and isolation
  forest require careful feature engineering when applied to structured domains like
  images. State-of-the-art methods aim to leverage deep learning to learn appropriate
  features via two main approaches. The first approach based on predicting transformations
  (Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019a) while successful in some domains,
  crucially depends on an appropriate domain-specific set of transformations that
  are hard to obtain in general. The second approach of minimizing a classical one-class
  loss on the learned final layer representations, e.g., DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018)
  suffers from the fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work,
  we propose Deep Robust One Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable
  to most standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to representation
  collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from the class of interest
  lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation
  demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in two different one-class problem settings
  and on a range of real-world datasets across different domains: tabular data, images
  (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and time-series, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy
  over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML'
