abstract: We present a unified framework based on primal-dual stochastic mirror descent
  for approximately solving infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) given
  a generative model. When applied to an average-reward MDP with $A_{tot}$ total actions
  and mixing time bound $t_{mix}$ our method computes an $\epsilon$-optimal policy
  with an expected $\widetilde{O}(t_{mix}^2 A_{tot} \epsilon^{-2})$ samples from the
  state-transition matrix, removing the ergodicity dependence of prior art. When applied
  to a $\gamma$-discounted MDP with $A_{tot}$ total actions our method computes an
  $\epsilon$-optimal policy with an expected $\widetilde{O}((1-\gamma)^{-4} A_{tot}
  \epsilon^{-2})$ samples, improving over the best-known primal-dual methods while
  matching the state-of-the-art up to a $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ factor. Both methods are
  model-free, update state values and policies simultaneously, and run in time linear
  in the number of samples taken. We achieve these results through a more general
  stochastic mirror descent framework for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with
  simplex and box domains and we demonstrate the flexibility of this framework by
  providing further applications to constrained MDPs.
