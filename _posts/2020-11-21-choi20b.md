abstract: We consider the problem of learning high-level controls over the global
  structure of generated sequences, particularly in the context of symbolic music
  generation with complex language models. In this work, we present the Transformer
  autoencoder, which aggregates encodings of the input data across time to obtain
  a global representation of style from a given performance. We show it is possible
  to combine this global representation with other temporally distributed embeddings,
  enabling improved control over the separate aspects of performance style and melody.
  Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various music generation
  tasks on the MAESTRO dataset and a YouTube dataset with 10,000+ hours of piano performances,
  where we achieve improvements in terms of log-likelihood and mean listening scores
  as compared to baselines.
