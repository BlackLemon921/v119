abstract: When machine learning models are deployed on a test distribution different
  from the training distribution, they can perform poorly, but overestimate their
  performance. In this work, we aim to better estimate a modelâ€™s performance under
  distribution shift, without supervision. To do so, we use a set of domain-invariant
  predictors as a proxy for the unknown, true target labels. Since the error of the
  resulting risk estimate depends on the target risk of the proxy model, we study
  generalization of domain-invariant representations and show that the complexity
  of the latent representation has a significant influence on the target risk. Empirically,
  our approach (1) enables self-tuning of domain adaptation models, and (2) accurately
  estimates the target error of given models under distribution shift. Other applications
  include model selection, deciding early stopping and error detection.
