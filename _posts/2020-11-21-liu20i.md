abstract: Deep generative modeling has achieved many successes for continuous data
  generation, such as producing realistic images and controlling their properties
  (e.g., styles). However, the development of generative modeling techniques for optimizing
  discrete data, such as sequences or strings, still lags behind largely due to the
  challenges in modeling complex and long-range constraints, including both syntax
  and semantics, in discrete structures. In this paper, we formulate the sequence
  optimization task as a chance-constrained optimization problem. The key idea is
  to enforce a high probability of generating valid sequences and also optimize the
  property of interest. We propose a novel minimax algorithm to simultaneously tighten
  a bound of the valid chance and optimize the expected property. Extensive experimental
  results in three domains demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing
  sequence optimization methods.
