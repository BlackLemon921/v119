abstract: Recent work has shown that topological enhancements to recurrent neural
  networks (RNNs) can increase their expressiveness and representational capacity.
  Two popular enhancements are stacked RNNs, which increases the capacity for learning
  non-linear functions, and bidirectional processing, which exploits acausal information
  in a sequence. In this work, we explore the delayed-RNN, which is a single-layer
  RNN that has a delay between the input and output. We prove that a weight-constrained
  version of the delayed-RNN is equivalent to a stacked-RNN. We also show that the
  delay gives rise to partial acausality, much like bidirectional networks. Synthetic
  experiments confirm that the delayed-RNN can mimic bidirectional networks, solving
  some acausal tasks similarly, and outperforming them in others. Moreover, we show
  similar performance to bidirectional networks in a real-world natural language processing
  task. These results suggest that delayed-RNNs can approximate topologies including
  stacked RNNs, bidirectional RNNs, and stacked bidirectional RNNs – but with equivalent
  or faster runtimes for the delayed-RNNs.
