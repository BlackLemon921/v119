abstract: Learning community structures in graphs that are randomly generated by stochastic
  block models (SBMs) has received much attention lately. In this paper, we focus
  on the problem of exactly recovering the communities in a binary symmetric SBM,
  where a graph of $n$ vertices is partitioned into two equal-sized communities and
  the vertices are connected with probability $p = \alpha\log(n)/n$ within communities
  and $q = \beta\log(n)/n$ across communities for some $\alpha>\beta>0$. We propose
  a two-stage iterative algorithm for solving this problem, which employs the power
  method with a random starting point in the first-stage and turns to a generalized
  power method that can identify the communities in a finite number of iterations
  in the second-stage. It is shown that for any fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that
  $\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{\beta} > \sqrt{2}$, which is known to be the information-theoretical
  limit for exact recovery, the proposed algorithm exactly identifies the underlying
  communities in $\tilde{O}(n)$ running time with probability tending to one as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
  We also present numerical results of the proposed algorithm to support and complement
  our theoretical development.
