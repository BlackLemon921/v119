abstract: Humans have the ability to robustly recognize objects with various factors
  of variations such as nonrigid transformations, background noises, and changes in
  lighting conditions. However, training deep learning models generally require huge
  amount of data instances under diverse variations, to ensure its robustness. To
  alleviate the need of collecting large amount of data and better learn to generalize
  with scarce data instances, we propose a novel meta-learning method which learns
  to transfer factors of variations from one class to another, such that it can improve
  the classification performance on unseen examples. Transferred variations generate
  virtual samples that augment the feature space of the target class during training,
  simulating upcoming query samples with similar variations. By sharing the factors
  of variations across different classes, the model becomes more robust to variations
  in the unseen examples and tasks using small number of examples per class. We validate
  our model on multiple benchmark datasets for few-shot classification and face recognition,
  on which our model significantly improves the performance of the base model, outperforming
  relevant baselines.
