abstract: We study the heavy-tailed stochastic bandit problem in the cooperative multi-agent
  setting, where a group of agents interact with a common bandit problem, while communicating
  on a network with delays. Existing algorithms for the stochastic bandit in this
  setting utilize confidence intervals arising from an averaging-based communication
  protocol known as running consensus, that does not lend itself to robust estimation
  for heavy-tailed settings. We propose MP-UCB, a decentralized multi-agent algorithm
  for the cooperative stochastic bandit that incorporates robust estimation with a
  message-passing protocol. We prove optimal regret bounds for MP-UCB for several
  problem settings, and also demonstrate its superiority to existing methods. Furthermore,
  we establish the first lower bounds for the cooperative bandit problem, in addition
  to providing efficient algorithms for robust bandit estimation of location.
