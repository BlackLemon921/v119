abstract: Atari games have been a long-standing benchmark in the reinforcement learning
  (RL) community for the past decade. This benchmark was proposed to test general
  competency of RL algorithms. Previous work has achieved good average performance
  by doing outstandingly well on many games of the set, but very poorly in several
  of the most challenging games. We propose Agent57, the first deep RL agent that
  outperforms the standard human benchmark on all 57 Atari games. To achieve this
  result, we train a neural network which parameterizes a family of policies ranging
  from very exploratory to purely exploitative. We propose an adaptive mechanism to
  choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process. Additionally,
  we utilize a novel parameterization of the architecture that allows for more consistent
  and stable learning.
