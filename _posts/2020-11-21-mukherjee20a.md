abstract: Individual fairness is an intuitive definition of algorithmic fairness that
  addresses some of the drawbacks of group fairness. Despite its benefits, it depends
  on a task specific fair metric that encodes our intuition of what is fair and unfair
  for the ML task at hand, and the lack of a widely accepted fair metric for many
  ML tasks is the main barrier to broader adoption of individual fairness. In this
  paper, we present two simple ways to learn fair metrics from a variety of data types.
  We show empirically that fair training with the learned metrics leads to improved
  fairness on three machine learning tasks susceptible to gender and racial biases.
  We also provide theoretical guarantees on the statistical performance of both approaches.
