abstract: Many automated machine learning methods, such as those for hyperparameter
  and neural architecture optimization, are computationally expensive because they
  involve training many different model configurations. In this work, we present a
  new method that saves computational budget by terminating poor configurations early
  on in the training. In contrast to existing methods, we consider this task as a
  ranking and transfer learning problem. We qualitatively show that by optimizing
  a pairwise ranking loss and leveraging learning curves from other data sets, our
  model is able to effectively rank learning curves without having to observe many
  or very long learning curves. We further demonstrate that our method can be used
  to accelerate a neural architecture search by a factor of up to 100 without a significant
  performance degradation of the discovered architecture. In further experiments we
  analyze the quality of ranking, the influence of different model components as well
  as the predictive behavior of the model.
