abstract: 'Space-filling designs such as Low Discrepancy Sequence (LDS), Latin Hypercube
  Sampling (LHS) and Jittered Sampling (JS) were proposed for fully parallel hyperparameter
  search, and were shown to be more effective than random and grid search. We prove
  that LHS and JS outperform random search only by a constant factor. Consequently,
  we introduce a new sampling approach based on the reshaping of the search distribution,
  and we show both theoretically and numerically that it leads to significant gains
  over random search. Two methods are proposed for the reshaping: Recentering (when
  the distribution of the optimum is known), and Cauchy transformation (when the distribution
  of the optimum is unknown). The proposed methods are first validated on artificial
  experiments and simple real-world tests on clustering and Salmon mappings. Then
  we demonstrate that they drive performance improvement in a wide range of expensive
  artificial intelligence tasks, namely attend/infer/repeat, video next frame segmentation
  forecasting and progressive generative adversarial networks.'
