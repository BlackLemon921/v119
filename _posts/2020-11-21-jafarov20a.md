abstract: 'In the Correlation Clustering problem, we are given a weighted graph $G$
  with its edges labelled as "similar" or "dissimilar" by a binary classifier. The
  goal is to produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of "disagreements": the
  sum of the weights of "similar" edges across clusters and "dissimilar" edges within
  clusters. We study the correlation clustering problem under the following assumption:
  Every "similar" edge $e$ has weight $w_e \in [ \alpha w, w ]$ and every "dissimilar"
  edge $e$ has weight $w_e \geq \alpha w$ (where $\alpha \leq 1$ and $w > 0$ is a
  scaling parameter). We give a $(3 + 2 \log_e (1/\alpha))$ approximation algorithm
  for this problem. This assumption captures well the scenario when classification
  errors are asymmetric. Additionally, we show an asymptotically matching Linear Programming
  integrality gap of $\Omega(\log 1/\alpha)$.'
