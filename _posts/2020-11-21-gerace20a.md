abstract: We study generalised linear regression and classification for a synthetically
  generated dataset encompassing different problems of interest, such as learning
  with random features, neural networks in the lazy training regime, and the hidden
  manifold model. We consider the high-dimensional regime and using the replica method
  from statistical physics, we provide a closed-form expression for the asymptotic
  generalisation performance in these problems, valid in both the under- and over-parametrised
  regimes and for a broad choice of generalised linear model loss functions. In particular,
  we show how to obtain analytically the so-called double descent behaviour for logistic
  regression with a peak at the interpolation threshold, we illustrate the superiority
  of orthogonal against random Gaussian projections in learning with random features,
  and discuss the role played by correlations in the data generated by the hidden
  manifold model. Beyond the interest in these particular problems, the theoretical
  formalism introduced in this manuscript provides a path to further extensions to
  more complex tasks.
