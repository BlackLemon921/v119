abstract: Performing controlled experiments on noisy data is essential in understanding
  deep learning across noise levels. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, previous
  research has only examined deep learning on controlled synthetic label noise, and
  real-world label noise has never been studied in a controlled setting. This paper
  makes three contributions. First, we establish the first benchmark of controlled
  real-world label noise from the web. This new benchmark enables us to study the
  web label noise in a controlled setting for the first time. The second contribution
  is a simple but effective method to overcome both synthetic and real noisy labels.
  We show that our method achieves the best result on our dataset as well as on two
  public benchmarks (CIFAR and WebVision). Third, we conduct the largest study by
  far into understanding deep neural networks trained on noisy labels across different
  noise levels, noise types, network architectures, and training settings.
