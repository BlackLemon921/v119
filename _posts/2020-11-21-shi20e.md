abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to rely more on local texture
  rather than global shape when making decisions. Recent work also indicates a close
  relationship between CNN’s texture-bias and its robustness against distribution
  shift, adversarial perturbation, random corruption, etc. In this work, we attempt
  at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN’s texture
  bias. With inspiration from the human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic
  method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce
  texture bias. Specifically, we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information
  in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output
  from the local texture. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness
  under various scenarios (domain generalization, few-shot classification, image corruption,
  and adversarial perturbation). To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of
  the earliest attempts to improve different kinds of robustness in a unified model,
  shedding new light on the relationship between shape-bias and robustness, also on
  new approaches to trustworthy machine learning algorithms. Code is available at
