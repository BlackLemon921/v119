abstract: Recent work suggests that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) benefit
  disproportionately from large mini-batch sizes. This finding is interesting but
  also discouraging â€“ large batch sizes are slow and expensive to emulate on conventional
  hardware. Thus, it would be nice if there were some trick by which we could generate
  batches that were effectively big though small in practice. In this work, we propose
  such a trick, inspired by the use of Coreset-selection in active learning. When
  training a GAN, we draw a large batch of samples from the prior and then compress
  that batch using Coreset-selection. To create effectively large batches of real
  images, we create a cached dataset of Inception activations of each training image,
  randomly project them down to a smaller dimension, and then use Coreset-selection
  on those projected embeddings at training time. We conduct experiments showing that
  this technique substantially reduces training time and memory usage for modern GAN
  variants, that it reduces the fraction of dropped modes in a synthetic dataset,
  and that it helps us use GANs to reach a new state of the art in anomaly detection.
