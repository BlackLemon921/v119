abstract: We consider un-discounted reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov decision
  processes (MDPs) under drifting non-stationarity, \ie, both the reward and state
  transition distributions are allowed to evolve over time, as long as their respective
  total variations, quantified by suitable metrics, do not exceed certain \emph{variation
  budgets}. We first develop the Sliding Window Upper-Confidence bound for Reinforcement
  Learning with Confidence Widening (\texttt{SWUCRL2-CW}) algorithm, and establish
  its dynamic regret bound when the variation budgets are known. In addition, we propose
  the Bandit-over-Reinforcement Learning (\texttt{BORL}) algorithm to adaptively tune
  the \swÂ to achieve the same dynamic regret bound, but in a \emph{parameter-free}
  manner, \ie, without knowing the variation budgets. Notably, learning drifting MDPs
  via conventional optimistic exploration presents a unique challenge absent in existing
  (non-stationary) bandit learning settings. We overcome the challenge by a novel
  confidence widening technique that incorporates additional optimism.
