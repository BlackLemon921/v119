abstract: The problem of maximizing nonnegative monotone submodular functions under
  a certain constraint has been intensively studied in the last decade, and a wide
  range of efficient approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem.
  Many machine learning problems, including data summarization and influence maximization,
  can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions.
  However, when such applications involve sensitive data about individuals, their
  privacy concerns should be addressed. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing
  monotone submodular functions subject to matroid constraints in the framework of
  differential privacy. We provide $(1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}})$-approximation algorithm
  which improves upon the previous results in terms of approximation guarantee. This
  is done with an almost cubic number of function evaluations in our algorithm. Moreover,
  we study $k$-submodularity, a natural generalization of submodularity. We give the
  first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that preserves differential privacy
  for maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions subject to matroid constraints.
  The approximation ratio is asymptotically tight and is obtained with an almost linear
  number of function evaluations.
