abstract: Options have been shown to be an effective tool in reinforcement learning,
  facilitating improved exploration and learning. In this paper, we present an approach
  based on spectral graph theory and derive an algorithm that systematically discovers
  options without access to a specific reward or task assignment. As opposed to the
  common practice used in previous methods, our algorithm makes full use of the spectrum
  of the graph Laplacian. Incorporating modes associated with higher graph frequencies
  unravels domain subtleties, which are shown to be useful for option discovery. Using
  geometric and manifold-based analysis, we present a theoretical justification for
  the algorithm. In addition, we showcase its performance in several domains, demonstrating
  clear improvements compared to competing methods.
