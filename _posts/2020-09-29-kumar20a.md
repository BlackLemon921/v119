abstract: An important problem in machine auditory perception is to recognize and
  detect sound events. In this paper, we propose a sequential self-teaching approach
  to learning sounds. Our main proposition is that it is harder to learn sounds in
  adverse situations such as from weakly labeled and/or noisy labeled data, and in
  these situations a single stage of learning is not sufficient. Our proposal is a
  sequential stage-wise learning process that improves generalization capabilities
  of a given modeling system. We justify this method via technical results and on
  Audioset, the largest sound events dataset, our sequential learning approach can
  lead to up to 9% improvement in performance. A comprehensive evaluation also shows
  that the method leads to improved transferability of knowledge from previously trained
  models, thereby leading to improved generalization capabilities on transfer learning
  tasks.
