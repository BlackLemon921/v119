abstract: Modern neural networks have proven to be powerful function approximators,
  providing state-of-the-art performance in a multitude of applications. They however
  fall short in their ability to quantify confidence in their predictions — this is
  crucial in high-stakes applications that involve critical decision-making. Bayesian
  neural networks (BNNs) aim at solving this problem by placing a prior distribution
  over the network’s parameters, thereby inducing a posterior distribution that encapsulates
  predictive uncertainty. While existing variants of BNNs based on Monte Carlo dropout
  produce reliable (albeit approximate) uncertainty estimates over in-distribution
  data, they tend to exhibit over-confidence in predictions made on target data whose
  feature distribution differs from the training data, i.e., the covariate shift setup.
  In this paper, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference scheme based on posterior
  regularisation, wherein unlabelled target data are used as “pseudo-labels” of model
  confidence that are used to regularise the model’s loss on labelled source data.
  We show that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of uncertainty quantification
  on covariate-shifted data sets, with minimal modification to the underlying model
  architecture. We demonstrate the utility of our method in the context of transferring
  prognostic models of prostate cancer across globally diverse populations.
