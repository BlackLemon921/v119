abstract: Rank aggregation from pairwise preferences has widespread applications in
  recommendation systems and information retrieval. Given the enormous economic and
  societal impact of these applications, and the consequent incentives for malicious
  players to manipulate ranking outcomes in their favor, an important challenge is
  to make rank aggregation algorithms robust to adversarial manipulations in data.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of robustness in rank aggregation under the
  popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. We consider a setting
  where pairwise comparisons are initially generated according to a BTL model, but
  a fraction of these comparisons are corrupted by an adversary prior to being reported
  to us. We consider a strong contamination model, where an adversary having complete
  knowledge of the initial truthful data and the underlying true BTL parameters, can
  subsequently corrupt the truthful data by inserting, deleting, or changing data
  points. The goal is to estimate the true score/weight of each item under the BTL
  model, even in the presence of these corruptions. We characterize the extent of
  adversarial corruption under which the true BTL parameters are uniquely identifiable.
  We also provide a novel pruning algorithm that provably cleans the data of adversarial
  corruption under reasonable conditions on data generation and corruption. We corroborate
  our theory with experiments on both synthetic as well as real data showing that
  previous algorithms are vulnerable to even small amounts of corruption, whereas
  our algorithm can clean a reasonably high amount of corruption.
