abstract: Machine-learned predictors, although achieving very good results for inputs
  resembling training data, cannot possibly provide perfect predictions in all situations.
  Still, decision-making systems that are based on such predictors need not only to
  benefit from good predictions but also to achieve a decent performance when the
  predictions are inadequate. In this paper, we propose a prediction setup for arbitrary
  metrical task systems (MTS) (e.g., caching, k-server and convex body chasing) and
  online matching on the line. We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms
  to show how to make the setup robust. Specifically for caching, we present an algorithm
  whose performance, as a function of the prediction error, is exponentially better
  than what is achievable for general MTS. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation
  of our methods on real world datasets, which suggests practicality.
