abstract: 'A trade-off between accuracy and fairness is almost taken as a given in
  the existing literature on fairness in machine learning. Yet, it is not preordained
  that accuracy should decrease with increased fairness. Novel to this work, we examine
  fair classification through the lens of mismatched hypothesis testing: trying to
  find a classifier that distinguishes between two ideal distributions when given
  two mismatched distributions that are biased. Using Chernoff information, a tool
  in information theory, we theoretically demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief,
  there always exist ideal distributions such that optimal fairness and accuracy (with
  respect to the ideal distributions) are achieved simultaneously: there is no trade-off.
  Moreover, the same classifier yields the lack of a trade-off with respect to ideal
  distributions while yielding a trade-off when accuracy is measured with respect
  to the given (possibly biased) dataset. To complement our main result, we formulate
  an optimization to find ideal distributions and derive fundamental limits to explain
  why a trade-off exists on the given biased dataset. We also derive conditions under
  which active data collection can alleviate the fairness-accuracy trade-off in the
  real world. Our results lead us to contend that it is problematic to measure accuracy
  with respect to data that reflects bias, and instead, we should be considering accuracy
  with respect to ideal, unbiased data.'
