abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning in Linear Quadratic Control systems
  whose transition parameters are initially unknown. Recent results in this setting
  have demonstrated efficient learning algorithms with regret growing with the square
  root of the number of decision steps. We present new efficient algorithms that achieve,
  perhaps surprisingly,regret that scales only (poly-)logarithmically with the number
  of steps, in two scenarios: when only the state transition matrix A is unknown,
  and when only the state-action transition matrix B is unknown and the optimal policy
  satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition. On the other hand, we give a lower
  bound which shows that when the latter condition is violated, square root regret
  is unavoidable.'
