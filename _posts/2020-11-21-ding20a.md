abstract: 'We develop a novel variant of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which
  we call spectral Frank-Wolfe, for convex optimization over a spectrahedron. The
  spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm has a novel ingredient: it computes a few eigenvectors
  of the gradient and solves a small-scale subproblem in each iteration. Such a procedure
  overcomes the slow convergence of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm due to ignoring
  eigenvalue coalescence. We demonstrate that strict complementarity of the optimization
  problem is key to proving linear convergence of various algorithms, such as the
  spectral Frank-Wolfe algorithm as well as the projected gradient method and its
  accelerated version. We showcase that the strict complementarity is equivalent to
  the eigengap assumption on the gradient at the optimal solution considered in the
  literature. As a byproduct of this observation, we also develop a generalized block
  Frank-Wolfe algorithm and prove its linear convergence.'
