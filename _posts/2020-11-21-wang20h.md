abstract: Existing domain adaptation focuses on transferring knowledge between domains
  with categorical indices (e.g., between datasets A and B). However, many tasks involve
  continuously indexed domains. For example, in medical applications, one often needs
  to transfer disease analysis and prediction across patients of different ages, where
  age acts as a continuous domain index. Such tasks are challenging for prior domain
  adaptation methods since they ignore the underlying relation among domains. In this
  paper, we propose the first method for continuously indexed domain adaptation. Our
  approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with a novel discriminator
  that models the encoding-conditioned domain index distribution. Our theoretical
  analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging the domain index to generate invariant
  features across a continuous range of domains. Our empirical results show that our
  approach outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaption methods on both synthetic
  and real-world medical datasets.
