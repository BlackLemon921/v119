abstract: Recent work on policy learning from observational data has highlighted the
  importance of efficient policy evaluation and has proposed reductions to weighted
  (cost-sensitive) classification. But, efficient policy evaluation need not yield
  efficient estimation of policy parameters. We consider the estimation problem given
  by a weighted surrogate-loss classification with any score function, either direct,
  inverse-propensity-weighted, or doubly robust. We show that, under a correct specification
  assumption, the weighted classification formulation need not be efficient for policy
  parameters. We draw a contrast to actual (possibly weighted) binary classification,
  where correct specification implies a parametric model, while for policy learning
  it only implies a semi-parametric model. In light of this, we instead propose an
  estimation approach based on generalized method of moments, which is efficient for
  the policy parameters. We propose a particular method based on recent developments
  on solving moment problems using neural networks and demonstrate the efficiency
  and regret benefits of this method empirically.
