abstract: We consider the setting of distributed empirical risk minimization where
  multiple machines compute the gradients in parallel and a centralized server updates
  the model parameters. In order to reduce the number of communications required to
  reach a given accuracy, we propose a preconditioned accelerated gradient method
  where the preconditioning is done by solving a local optimization problem over a
  subsampled dataset at the server. The convergence rate of the method depends on
  the square root of the relative condition number between the global and local loss
  functions. We estimate the relative condition number for linear prediction models
  by studying uniform concentration of the Hessians over a bounded domain, which allows
  us to derive improved convergence rates for existing preconditioned gradient methods
  and our accelerated method. Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the benefits
  of acceleration in the ill-conditioned regime.
