abstract: We show that normalising flows become pathological when used to model targets
  whose supports have complicated topologies. In this scenario, we prove that a flow
  must become arbitrarily numerically noninvertible in order to approximate the target
  closely. This result has implications for all flow-based models, and especially
  residual flows (ResFlows), which explicitly control the Lipschitz constant of the
  bijection used. To address this, we propose continuously indexed flows (CIFs), which
  replace the single bijection used by normalising flows with a continuously indexed
  family of bijections, and which can intuitively "clean up" mass that would otherwise
  be misplaced by a single bijection. We show theoretically that CIFs are not subject
  to the same topological limitations as normalising flows, and obtain better empirical
  performance on a variety of models and benchmarks.
