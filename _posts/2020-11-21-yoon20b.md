abstract: Learning novel concepts while preserving prior knowledge is a long-standing
  challenge in machine learning. The challenge gets greater when a novel task is given
  with only a few labeled examples, a problem known as incremental few-shot learning.
  We propose XtarNet, which learns to extract task-adaptive representation (TAR) for
  facilitating incremental few-shot learning. The method utilizes a backbone network
  pretrained on a set of base categories while also employing additional modules that
  are meta-trained across episodes. Given a new task, the novel feature extracted
  from the meta-trained modules is mixed with the base feature obtained from the pretrained
  model. The process of combining two different features provides TAR and is also
  controlled by meta-trained modules. The TAR contains effective information for classifying
  both novel and base categories. The base and novel classifiers quickly adapt to
  a given task by utilizing the TAR. Experiments on standard image datasets indicate
  that XtarNet achieves state-of-the-art incremental few-shot learning performance.
  The concept of TAR can also be used in conjunction with existing incremental few-shot
  learning methods; extensive simulation results in fact show that applying TAR enhances
  the known methods significantly.
